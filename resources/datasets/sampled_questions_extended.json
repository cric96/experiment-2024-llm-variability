It is technically illegal here , but it is very hard to enforce in local villages . And younger girls are starting to be informed that they can go to the police if anyone tries to circumcise them , but this is leading adults to start circumcising infants .

This pressure helps with how quickly and hot the mixture will burn in the combustion chamber ( shake a cola in a bottle to see what this is all about ) 3 .

This is because the people who actually control the majority of the airplanes safety decisions , the pilots , are on board the craft , and if the craft fails , they die . By contrast , boats are among the most accident prone means of transportation . This is because ( despite ideas like the captain going down with the ship ) the kinds of accidents that ships encounter do n't usually threaten the captain , and even when they do , the people who make the more important safety decisions for ships are the owners ( who say whether you go through the storm or not , and whether you get a new engine or not ) who may risk some money , but not their lives . Too - big - to - fail ( TBTF ) banks are like ships . TBTF means that they are so important to the functioning of society that society will bail them out if there is a problem , even if they caused it . This reduces or eliminates any incentive for the TBTF bank to be cautious , since they know that , even if something bad happens , they will be saved . So it 's heads they win , tails everyone else loses , even if it would be cheaper for the TBTF entity to just play it safer . sometimes bailouts may be good policy and necessary . But the idea is to make banks more like planes , and less like ships .","Removing the notion of ' failing ' means that the bank has a lot less incentive to use discretion and caution . If they know the government will just bail them out when things get bad , then they can take greater risks with other people 's money .","This is a super complex issue ( which is probably why you asked it on \/r \/ ELI5 ) , and may be too complex of an explanation for ELI5 , but here goes : The best way to understand it is to look at the consequences of either avenue you choose to take ( NOTE : these are the extreme circumstances , IRL these would probably be tempered by the complexity of financial markets , gov't intervention , etc . , etc . ) 1 ) Let TBTF banks fail . Domino effect ensues per \/u \/ Historytech 's comment , or something similar to it . There 's a huge loss in ' liquidity ' ( meaning money ca n't get to where it needs to be fast enough ) , people ca n't get loans for mortgages , companies ca n't borrow money to float through seasonal or yearly changes , economy tanks , water shortage , civil war , dictators ( just kidding about the last three :P ) . On the upside , the surviving banks will make sure to never play it ' fast and loose ' again , but that also decreases the amount of money they loan out and therefore makes it more expensive to get loans , which only adds to the current problem . In the short term , things would get Great Depression bad in large scale economic terms . In the long term ( think * decades * , not years ) new banks would see how much money you can make and enter the market , increasing money being lent , decreasing the cost of borrowing and everything would return to normal , and probably be more stable than before since banks would be more cautious . 2 ) Save TBTF banks . Avoid domino effect and some short term harm to the economy . Economy dips , but the bottom is theoretically much better than the alternative . In the long term , banks have less ( and some , much less ) of an incentive to protect their assets ( read : other people 's cash ) against their own risky investing ( and since greater risk = greater reward , they go after more risky investments ) . Potentially , this could lead to much more risky behavior by banks and another crash \/ bailout cycle . It also leads to more financial institutions trying to raise themselves to TBTF status so they can be protected by the government from themselves . This leads to less competition and much less stability within financial markets ."],"14618":["To get away from this fucked up world , same reason young people do hallucinogenics","Because prune juice and centrum silver is a helluva drug .","I 'm 53 I guess that 's old to most Redditors .

When your brain listens to a simple beat it has no trouble with predicting what happens next in the song . This makes your brain release \" feel good \" chemicals and you end up liking the tune . As a melody gets complex you brain ca n't predict it correctly , thus no dopamine release . This causes you to not enjoy the song . But , as you listen to the same complex melody again and again , your brain starts picking up the changes and is able to predict them more accurately . After a while you start liking the song ( AND ANY SIMILAR SONGS ) because your brain adapted to the way the song changes . Simple beats are easier for people to get into because they do n't need to train their brain to predict any complex melodies . But if a song is too simple you get bored of it too quickly because there is not a lot of patterns for your brain to predict . When you invest time to train your brain in more complex melodies you actually get a \" higher \" feeling when listening to the song because there are so many more patterns for your brain to predict correctly . So good artists try to straddle a fine line where they want their song to be simple and catchy as well as dynamic and complex . This allows for an easy listening experience at first as well as a \" greater high \" as time goes on because your brain starts predicting every melody change in the song instead of just the simple ones . This is why classical music , with all its infinite twists and turns , is still being listened to today whereas pop music goes out of style quickly .","When I first listened to Blank Spaces , I hated it .

Before you start counting them , I tell you that there are an even number of them all together ( ELIActually5 : if you count them off two by two , there wo n't be any left over ) . After counting the pennies in the first bag , you already know if there are an even or odd number in the other bag . That 's how RAID parity works . We know that for any given bit , there are an even number of disks with a 1 there . So if you lose a single disk , you can rebuild the lost disk from the remaining information .","Take your file and split it up into groups of two bits ( i.e. two ones or zeroes ) . If you can store one set of two bits then you can do the same thing for the rest of the file , so we are left with a much simpler problem : Given 00 , 01 , 10 , or 11 , store values on 3 hard drives such that you could lose any of the 3 hard drives and still reconstruct the original data . The data that you write to the first two hard drives is easy : one stores the first bit , the other stores the second bit . If you lose the third drive then it does n't matter \u2014 your data was stored on the first two . For the third hard drive you ask \" How many ones were in the data that we 're storing ? \" If there was only one 1 ( e.g. 01 or 10 ) then you store a 1 ; if there were 0 or 2 ones then you store a 0 . If you 're using more than 3 hard drives then you ask \" was the number of ones even or odd ? \" . This means that you have the following table : Data | HD1 | HD2 | HD3 ----|---|---|--- 00 | 0 | 0 | 0 01 | 0 | 1 | 1 10 | 1 | 0 | 1 11 | 1 | 1 | 0 Now let 's say you lost Hard Drive number 1 . You look and you see that HD2 had a 0 and HD3 had a 1 . There 's only one row of this table that matches that , which was when the data was 10 . No matter what combination of HD2 and HD3 you have there 's always only one row of this table that matches . Same if HD2 broke and you just have HD1 and HD3 .","So parity in general works like this - let 's say we have eight data bits and one parity bit , although the actual number of data bits is not terribly important . Here 's our data : 01001100 So that 's three bits set to 1 , and five set to 0 . And our algorithm says that we 're going to use * even * parity , so we need to add another 1 to make an even number of ones . Therefore our parity bit is a 1 : 01001100 +1 Now , we have an event that destroys the fifth bit : 0100X100 +1 We do n't know what that fifth bit was , but we know we are using even parity , so we can deduce that it was a one . We rebuild it , thus : 0100**1**100 +1 RAID works pretty much the same way , in the flavors where it uses parity to protect against lost data . In RAID 4 , we use one whole disk for nothing but parity information , and in RAID 5 , we spread the data and the parity information across all of the disks . In RAID 6 , the parity info is recorded twice in separate places , so we need n+2 disks rather than n+1 ."],"14366":["Because the voluntary disclosure of personal information is completely different from the involuntary gathering of personal data .","Because they are controlling what they are sharing online .

For this reason , many of Scotland 's policies are not decided by a Scottish parliament , but rather by the superseding combined government , which resides in London . So for instance , when the United Kingdom decided to go to war against Iraq in 2003 , the Scottish people were obliged to go along . And when the United Kingdom enters an agreement within the Nato , the Scottish people have no say in it . Some Scottish people ( united in the Scottish Nationalist Party ) are not happy with this state of affairs . Furthermore , it turns out that Scotland is rather rich in natural resources , such as oil from the North Sea and single malt whisky . As matters stand , the proceedings of exploiting this richness are going for a very large part to persons of not Scottish origin . Again , this is reason for the Scottish National Party to cry foul . As for the effects of an independent Scotland : I personally think it would become more or less like the Republic of Ireland , minus the Euro . Which would not be bad .

( If you are familiar with postmodernism , this probably made sense to you ... if not , then probably not . ) * * Skip to the bottom for a tl;dr , I guess , and also for a \" postmodern \" joke . * * And if you have zero background in philosophy , you probably wo n't be able to understand postmodernism in the context of the history leading up to it , which of course is kind of \" the point \" of postmodernism , to the extent that postmodernism \" has \" a single \" point \" , which of course it does n't . Man , I have n't written about postmodernism in a long time , and I 've forgotten how incredibly * meta * and * self - referential * it feels . I 'm sure that everything that follows will be pure bunk . But here goes : First off , the term . \" Postmodern \" originated , I believe , in architecture circles . There was a Modern school \/ style of architecture . \" Postmodern \" was used to label the work of architects who came after the Modern school and who rejected the assumptions \/ style \/ whatever of the Modern school . This is n't a particularly important point but it 's where my philosophy professor started when I took postmodernism in college , so that 's where I 'll start . Because knowledge should always follow the form of the teacher . ( Ha ha that 's another postmodern joke . ) Anyway . There were a bunch of philosophers - Descartes comes to mind , but also Spinoza and a bunch of others - who went about trying to construct a grand theory of meaning . They were trying to figure out where meaning comes from - from God ? from humans ? from society ? They all had a similar idea : meaning flowed from one single source , much like a light in the center of a web of fiber optic cable . What is \" good \" , what is \" evil \" , what is \" real \" , what is \" not real \" - we can answer all these questions by looking at the center and figuring it out . This is why so many philosophers spent a great deal of time coming up with logical proofs for the existence of God - they figured that God had to be the center \/ source of all meaning , so they had to show that God existed in order to make sense of reality . Along come the existentialists . ELI5 version : the existentialists take God out of the center and replace God with the mortal self . In other words , God is n't the source of meaning , it 's ourselves - or rather , the source of meaning for me is my self , for you it 's your self . This is an extremely unfair simplification of existentialism but it will suit for our purpose . So the existentialists , and the philosophers before them , were all about tracing meaning back to the center . They just disagreed over the center - what was it , was it God or the self ? Was it something else maybe ? What could we know about the source of all meaning ? Then came the postmodernists . Everyone else was constructing these elaborate systems of meaning , with either God or the self at the center as the ultimate source of meaning , and all meaning could be determined in some way through a relationship with the center . The postmodernists chuckled to themselves , and then blew up the center . The postmodernists say , there is no god that gives meaning to everything , and the self does n't give meaning to everything either . Come to think of it , say the postmodernists , there is no such thing as \" meaning \" after all - so stop fucking around trying to find the source of all meaning , what a silly project . The postmodernist approach is that \" everything \" \" is \" \" contextual \" - outside of a specific moment involving specific people , there is no meaning to be found . There are no broad , over - arching truths to be found out about the world . According to the postmodernists , those sorts of broad assertions of fact \/ truth are meaningless and empty - in fact , the postmodernists go one step further : they say that all those assertions of truth are * inherently unstable . * What the hell does that mean ? It means that any assertion of \" fact \" inherently contradicts itself and thus falls apart under analysis . This is a really weird thing to explain to someone who has n't been exposed to postmodernism , so I wo n't bother to explain it further . Just know that postmodernists resist attempts to define things because they think the definitions will always be inaccurate and self - defeating . ( By the way , my entire explanation of postmodernism , up to this point , is an example of something that will contradict itself and fall apart under scrutiny - you want an example of postmodernism in action , just watch subsequent comments which disagree with my explanation . If anybody bothers to write any . ) The other big thing from postmodernism is the idea that not only is meaning a contingent thing , it is a relation . When someone asserts \" the truth \" about something , they are saying \" the truth \" to someone else - in other words , when meaning is asserted , it is asserted in the context of a human relationship . The postmodernists would tell you that all human relationships have a power dynamic , and often the assertion of meaning is a fundamental assertion of power over another person : when you assert meaning , you are trying to get your listener to accept your assertion , which means that you are controlling the meaning of reality ( in a sense ) . By the way , postmodernists do not say that \" right \" and \" wrong \" do n't exist - that 's a common misconception of postmodernism . Instead , what postmodernists say is that judgments of \" right \" and \" wrong \" are tied to the very specific circumstances under consideration , including the relationships of all the people involved ( the judge , the judged , the witnesses , etc . ) And \" right \" and \" wrong \" , in addition to being contingent upon circumstances , are also * negotiated * by all the people involved - it is rarely that one person unilaterally determines what is right versus wrong , rather it is through relationships with others in a physical , living moment , that \" right \" and \" wrong \" are determined - indeed , this is how all meaning is determined . * * TL;DR :* * \" Postmodernism \" \" means \" that \" everything \" \" is \" \" in quotation marks . \" This will probably only make sense to people who are already familiar with postmodernism . Sorry . Also , the best postmodern joke was in The Onion years ago when Derrida died . There was just one line , no article , and it was a throw - away joke but it was brilliant : the headline read : Derrida \" dies \"","There are some very good responses in here , and I have to give props to hpcisco7965 for the in depth historical context . Just for fun , and in the spirit of ELI5 , I 'm going to do my best to reduce the definition as simply and straightforwardly as I can : * Modernism was a literary , art , and cultural movement that focused heavily on representation and constructed meanings . For instance , modern art expected viewers to draw complex conclusions from that which did not otherwise appear to \" mean \" anything . Literature wanted to create complex meaning between events , characters , symbols , etc . in a way many readers would consider over - analyzing . * Postmodernism is a rejection of that . At first , it was anything that critiqued ( often satirically ) this line of thinking . Imagine a piece of modern art that is n't * supposed * to mean anything . * At postmodernism developed , it became a way to deconstruct * everything . * Postmodernists went on to assert that nothing has actual meaning other that what we have decided .","While on this topic can anyone enlighten me to what Realism , Modernity , and Modernism is referring to in the context of Enlish literature ?"],"9822":["When you record an album , generally you record each instrument onto separate audio tracks that play back together ; it does n't matter if you 're doing it digitally or on an old analog console , or if you 're recording a band live via multitracking or just overdubbing ... it 's all the same idea . When you 're \" mixing , \" you 're changing those separate audio tracks in relation to each other .

Making sure there is n't unneeded side chaining , cleaning up white noise . Basically the finishing touches .","Adding to what others have said , I 'd like to explain what compression \/ limiting is . It 's a large part of the mastering process , especially in modern music . At it 's core , compression involves decreasing dynamic range . That is , making louder sounds and quieter sounds closer to the same volume . What this accomplishes is making the song sound more \" full \" , which in turn makes it sound louder to the ear overall . This technique can accomplish different things , from just \" cutting off the top \" of things like snare drums to make them blend in more , to making individual sections of the song closer to the same volume , so that soft sections sound as full as loud sections . There are disadvantages to heavy limiting and compression , like a drastic loss of dynamic range , which is the subject of the \" loudness war \" debate , which you can look up if you want more info . [ Here 's ] ( URL_0 ) some examples of songs before and after mastering . Why is heavy mastering so popular in recent years ? Well , it started out that people wanted their records ( vinyl records , that is ) to sound \" hotter \" than other people 's records when they 'd be played through jukeboxes , so that their song would stick out from the crowd . The real question is , do louder masters sound better ? Well , it 's a subject of debate , but in my opinion is depends heavily on the music genre and what you expect people to listen to it on . Background music that 's being played through a bluetooth speaker like a Jambox might benefit from some extra compression , because with those the goal really is just to fill dead air with music , and loud masters do that better than quiet masters . When you 're listening to music for the \" experience \" of it , through a Hi - Fi home audio system or headphones for example , a lighter master will generally do better . I 'd like to point out , quickly , that this is just my opinion . Many people advocate for less mastering in general , and for the \" mastering \" to be done on the sound devices themselves . So the bluetooth speaker might have a \" loudness \" button you could press to do the compression on - the - fly , to meet the needs of the listener . This is so people who want the dynamic range can have it on their Hi - Fi , and so people who listen less critically and on less - capable systems ( volume and sound quality wise ) can have a more \" full \" sound when they want it ."],"13729":["A lot more than the \" fundamental code framework \" . It 's a big layer between the functions of the computer ( and often and particularly , the graphics card ) and the functions of the game . Many engines such as the Unreal engine are licenseable , meaning you can pay their authors a fee to use their engine as the foundation of your game . Why it 's great is instead of having to write a function yourself to , say , cause explosion debris to act in a certain way or cause lava to flow in a specific pattern and viscosity , you can call the function within the game engine itself that does this , saving you a lot of time for writing and testing . Ditto for lots of other stuff such as complex lighting effects involving water or smoke , libraries of animation model approaches such as skeletal movements , realistic lighting , and lots of other goodies that remove a tremendous amount of the work required to write your precise and exact game .

The modeler can then use these algorithms to do what he wants , i.e. set how reflective the tank is , so the engine 's light reflection algorithm knows how to interact with it . Think about a similar system as an operating system and a program .

The problem was that in the last 2000 years another group of people had come to live there . They called themselves the Palestinians . When the Jews asked for their land back , the Palestinians told them that it was no longer their land . In 1947 , Israel took back the land by force and forced the Palestinians out . in 1967 another war broke out ( it lasted six days ) and the Israelis gained even more land . Now the Palestinians are mostly impoverished living in the few spots that Israel had n't taken for themselves . TL;DR Both the Israelis and Palestinians claim that the geographic area that we know as Israel today is theirs and neither side wants to give up that claim . It is obviously more nuanced than that . The British essentially promised both the Jews and the Arabs living in Palestine that they could have the land . When both sides tried to hold Britain to that promise , the British just left .

It completely dehumanises Palestinians who are in fact , like you and I , very very human ) . And that 's what I gathered from the first twenty minutes . Could not finish watching it . Basically , in the late 1800s a man named Theodore Herzl created the modern Zionist movement - a political ideology and the belief \/ goal of a homeland for Jews only . Britain gave Jews \/ Herzl \/ political players the land of Palestine ( read about the Balfour Declaration , agreed upon in 1930s ) . So in 1947 and in 1948 , Jewish people migrated to Palestine and Jewish forces ethnically cleansed Palestine ( read about the Jewish terrorist groups Irgun and Hagana - they destroyed and massacred whole Palestinian towns and villages , one of the most prominent massacres is the Deir Yassin massacre before taking over ) . They expelled three - quarters of the Palestinian population ( and today , there are five million Palestinian refugees - stateless - who are not allowed the right to return to their homeland , Palestine ) . There is a large Palestinian diaspora . Now , the issue is that Palestine was stolen and dispossessed . Palestinians are forced to live under a military occupation ( checkpoints , the segregation wall built around the West Bank , curfews etc ) and an apartheid system that privileges Jews over them ( Jewish only roads , laws that discriminates against Palestinians , pass \/ permit system ) . Israel keeps confiscating land , demolishing Palestinian homes and destroying trees , farms , crops etc and building illegal Jewish settlements . Israel 's also blockaded and besieged Gaza , essentially trying to starve the 1.5 million Palestinians . Raids , the imprisonment of innocent Palestinians ( Palestinians in the occupied territories are ' tried ' in military courts - obviously no justice ) , the use of drones and white phosphorous bombs , attacking and killing protesters etc are part of Palestinian daily life . It really boils down to land theft , occupation , apartheid and no right of return for Palestinians because Israel wants to be a state for Jews only ."],"16459":["The European standard for measuring acceleration is the time for 0 - 100 * kilometers * per hour .

What you experienced is what 's know as \" clear air turbulence \" or CAT , and is an annoying sort of turbulence . Normally , the pilots are able to predict where the ( non - cat)-turbulence is , by simple using the weather radar in the nose of the aircraft to scan for water droplets ahed . Water droplets are good indicators of turbulence since \" normal \" turbulence is experienced inside ( or near ) certain forms of cumulus clouds . Cumulus clouds are the onces that look the cauliflower . They are created by air warming near the surface of the earth , which then breaks free and rises through the comparatively cooler air that surrounds it . When it does so , it gradually cools ( until it has the same temperature as the surrounding air ) at which point it will no longer rise . Somewhere in this process , it is more than likely that the air will become saturated with moisture ( the relative humidity will hit 100 % due to cooling ) and water droplets will form and fall as rain . Anyhow : That was NOT what you experienced , since this form of turbulence can easily be avoided , and can be VERY dangerous \/ severe . What you experienced was CAT , which sucks because there is no way ( nearly ) of predicting where it occurs . It normally occurs in one of two ways : either at the boundaries of a jetstream ( high - altitude FAST bands of wind streaming around due to coriolis forces ... ) or as a consequence of mountain waves . The jet - stream - induced type is generally fairly mild , and ca n't be precisely predicted , but when one aircraft encounters it , the location and altitude is reported so other aircraft can circumvent it . The mountain - induced types are often more severe , but can be somewhat predicted . They happen when wind blows fairly strongly over a mountain range which starts oscillations in the wind pattern which can continue for several 100 miles past the mountain chain . Experience tell you that on a day with winds of so and so speeds from just that direction , there is a good risk of CAT there and there . Hope this helps . :)","Tectonic plates crash into each other and produce earthquakes and mountains . Air masses in the atmosphere do n't live as long , but it 's the same principle . They 're the size of continents , they float around , and interesting things happen at the fronts where two air masses crash into each other . The bottom of every air mass is heated by the ground . This creates a zone where cold air sits above hot air , the troposphere . Above that , there 's another zone where hot ( less - cold ) air sits above cold air , the stratosphere . The cold air between them is the tropopause . This air is so cold that most water turns to ice . Thus clouds are rare in the tropopause and stratosphere . Convection at that level does n't make clouds like it does at lower altitudes . Heavy clear - air turbulence is best found between two masses with different temperature . The cold - mass has a lower ( and warmer ) tropopause , which spills into the neighboring troposphere . Likewise , the high tropopause spills into the neighboring stratosphere . Because everything is rotating with the Earth , this air does n't just tumble around the front , it 's pushed along the front at a few hundred miles per hour .

The same happens with your eyes . If you look at something long enough , your brain will add a little bit of the opposite color so your eyes are n't constantly telling your brain everything that it sees . But if you suddenly take away ( or change ) that feed from your eyes , you have an afterimage . The afterimage is that negating effect from your brain before your brain realizes that something different is happening .","Imagine that light is blue paint , and your eyes ( or , the back of your eyes , really ) are a big , red canvas . When you look at something , you get some blue paint onto your red canvas . If it 's just a few drops of paint , then you see the blue on the red for a few moments before it all runs down to show red behind it , again . Now , when you look into a flashlight ( or any other really strong light ) , it 's like throwing * a lot * of blue onto your red canvas . When that same blue paint runs down the canvas , just like the other blue paint , having so much more of it causes the colors to run together . Instead of blue on red , you actually see purple ( which is blue and red together ! ) . The paint * always * ends up running down the canvas , what makes the purple so bright is just how much blue you use .","There are cells in your eye that detect brightness and color ( red , green , and blue ) .

The same sort of thing happens with white light , which has all those colors in it . But , some of the color - detecting cells get tired faster than others . If you close your eyes and see blue , it 's because the red and green cells are more tired than the blue ones .

But I 'll explain the concept LY5 . ( and let someone else do the math part if they want . ) A derivative tells you how fast something is changing . It 's a number telling you a * rate of change * . Let 's say we 're driving down the road in a car . At 5 o'clock we are at mile marker 10 , and at 5:01 we are at mile marker 11 . Our position on the road was 10 at time 5:00 , and it was 11 at time 5:01 . So how much did our position change ? It changed by one mile in one minute . So , we were moving at 60 miles per hour . That 's why we say that velocity ( or speed in a car ) is the * derivative * of position . If you took a graph with position on the y - axis and velocity on the x - axis , you would see that , at time 5:00 , we were at position 10 , and at time 5:01 ( one unit to the right ) , we were at position 11 ( one unit upward ) . So if we drew a line from the first point to the second , it would look like this : 12 | | | 11 | o | \/ | \/ | \/ 10 | o ------------------------- 5:00 5:01 5:02 ... This line tells us our * * position * * over time . At 5:00 , we were at marker 10 ; at 5:01 , we were at marker 11 , and so on . And so , we can ask , what 's the * slope * of that line ? It goes up by one unit and over by one unit . So for every one ( mile ) it goes up , it goes one ( minute ) to the right . So the slope is * * 1 mile \/ minute * * , which is the derivative of our position . Here 's some extra food for thought : When you step on the gas pedal of your car , the car speeds up , right ? So say you 're going 60 mph when you hit the gas , hard , and in two seconds , you 've gone up to 70 mph . So in those two seconds , your * velocity * has changed by 10 miles per hour . So what is the rate of change of your velocity ? It changed by 5 miles per hour each second . ( It did this for the two seconds you hit the gas , making a total change of 10 miles per hour -- from 60 up to 70 . ) So your * acceleration * -- the derivative of velocity -- was : ( 5 miles per hour ) per second . Just like velocity is the derivative of position , acceleration is the derivative of velocity .","Derivatives are rates of change . Everything else about them is real calculus and beyond the bounds of this forum , though definitely interesting and worth your time . Good luck .","Really easy ! Say you got a line . y = 3x + 2 . What 's the slope ? If you said 3 , you remember middle school algebra . If you did n't , you should go back and learn it . Any four - year - old should know this , and as you are five , you should DEFINITELY know this . Anyway . Say you have a * curve * instead of a line , like y = x^2 . What 's the slope ? Well , there is n't one ! It 's a curve ! But at any particular point on the curve , you can draw a line that just barely touches it and does n't cross it ( with some exceptions , but that 's later ) . THAT line has a slope . At x = 0 , for example , the curve y = x^2 is flat , so the slope is 0 . At x = 1 , though , the slope is 2 , and at x = -3 , the slope is -6 . Actually , whatever x is , the slope is 2x . We call 2x the derivative of x^2 . It 's much easier to do this using pictures . Go to URL_0 and look at some there , because that will help you . Now , you want to know how to take a derivative , right ? This is called differentiating , NOT \" deriving \" . Well , if you have a polynomial , where each term is something like ax^k , it 's really easy to take the derivative : the derivative of x^n is nx^(n-1 ) . And derivatives add , so the derivative of x^2 is 2x and the derivative of x^3 is 3x^2 , so the derivative of 5x^2 - 4x^3 is 10x - 12x^2 . Simple ! There are also a whole bunch of rules . If f(x ) is the function , f'(x ) is the derivative , or you could write it df \/ dx , or ( d \/ dx)f . If you want to take the derivative at x = 1 , then you 'd do f'(1 ) or ( df \/ dx)|_1 ( that 's a long vertical line with a 1 at the bottom , or an x = 1 if there are many variables ) . If you have some function f(x , y ) , you can also take a derivative of just x or just y , but that 's multivariable calculus and that 's LY12 . Anyway . Here are some of those rules , where f and g are functions , x is the variable , and everything else is a number : ( af + bg ) ' = af ' + bg ' ( easy ) ( fg ) ' = f'g + fg ' ( multiplication rule , it 's not obvious ) ( f(g ) ) ' = f'(g)g ' ( chain rule ) ( f \/ g ) ' = ( f'g - fg')\/g^2 ( quotient rule ) Some common derivatives : ( d \/ dx)ax^n = anx^(n-1 ) ( polynomials ; this applies to negative n , too , but remember that if n = -1 , then n-1 = -2 ) ( d \/ dx)ax = a ( special case for a line -- remember that the derivative is the slope ) ( d \/ dx)a = 0 ( derivative of a constant is 0 , since the slope is 0 ) ( d \/ dx)sin(x ) = cos(x ) ( d \/ dx)cos(x ) = -sin(x ) ( to differentiate the other trig functions , just use the rules ) ( d \/ dx)e^x = e^x ( d \/ dx)ln(x ) = 1 \/ x If you go to URL_0 , you 'll see a lot more examples and practice problems . What are derivatives * for * ? Well , lots of stuff ! First of all , the derivative has a formal definition : f'(x ) = lim ( f(x + h ) - f(x))\/h as h goes to 0 . What does that mean ? It means this : for a very small change in x , what is the very small change that happens in f(x ) ? If y = 2x , then if x becomes bigger by some tiny number h , y becomes bigger by 2h . So the derivative is ( 2h)\/h = 2 . If y = x^2 , if x becomes bigger by h , y becomes ( x + h)^2 = x^2 + 2xh + h^2 , so it becomes bigger by 2xh + h^2 . So the derivative is ( 2xh + h^2)\/h = 2x + h , but since h is infinitely tiny -- we 're taking the limit as h goes to 0 -- that 's just 2x . This means that whenever we 're talking about tiny changes , derivatives are important , since they tell you how one thing changes when another thing changes . A differential equation is an equation where you have some equation involving derivatives of a function and you 're trying to discover the original function . The wave equation , the heat equation , the equations of fluids , and pretty much everything else used in physics are differential equations . Derivatives are also useful to optimize something . Look at any curve . Any curve whatsoever . Your roll of adhesive tape , or a can , or the blades of your fan , or anything , so long as it 's smooth -- no corners . Look at the lowest point on that curve . If you drew a line that just touched it at that point , without crossing the curve , would n't that line be horizontal ? That is , with slope 0 ? The highest and lowest points on a curve have derivative 0 ( Fermat knew this even before Newton invented calculus ) . So if you take a function and set the derivative to 0 , you 'll find one of the highest or lowest points . Of course , there could be some point that 's higher or lower somewhere else -- a peak is the highest point of the mountain , but unless it 's Everest , it 's not the highest point in the world -- but it 's still helpful to know all the points where the derivative is 0 . Of course , sometimes you know the derivative but want to find what it 's a derivative of . Maybe you know f'(x ) = 2x but you want to know what f(x ) is . Except that you know it 's x^2 , right ? WRONG . It could be x^2 + 1 , since the derivative of a constant ( 1 ) is 0 ! It could be x^2 + C , where C is any number at all . That 's called an antiderivative , or an integral . And we 're not going into those for now . (:"],"8459":["Well , this is not the reason , but I think if this were true , many high - school people would be in 3rd grade .","They 're based on both .

Chest compressions do n't restart a heart That being said , CPR does help keep someone from dying . When you perform CPR , the chest compressions keep just enough oxygenated blood following through the casualty to prevent their brain from dying . They probably wo n't wake up , but they might not die either .

This is an educated attempt at an explanation based on what I 've read and learned in the past . I could be wrong about some specifics , but as * I * understand it , this is what 's going on : By \" Bring someone back to life \" , I assume what they mean is once a brain has died , it does n't matter if you pump more oxygen to it , it 's not coming back . CPR is meant to do one thing : Keep the heart pumping blood , to make sure the brain still gets enough to survive . You 're essentially \" squeezing \" the heart to emulate the pumping action to keep blood moving . If a brain has n't died yet due to oxygen loss from lack of blood , then any tiny bit of blood you can get to the brain will help . CPR at least gives a small chance to keep blood moving enough that the brain does n't fail .

It 's an absolute last - ditch effort to try to save the brain until help arrives .

Both Fat Man and Little Boy only converted a tiny part of their fuel ( if I remember correctly , about a kilogram each ) .

Minor point of clarification here : Yeast is not a bacteria . It 's a ' unicellular eukaryote ' which is science lingo for : it 's organized on a cellular level like most of the big stuff on the planet , but it lives alone . We are eukaryotes , and on a cellular level are extremely similar to yeast . Where we start getting different is in the next level of structure : Our cells clump together and start working together to produce tissues , which make up organs , which make whole animals ; Yeast do n't do that . Every yeast organism will live and die all by it 's self . It never teams up with its friends to build a bigger ' something ' . Just a minor thing , but kind of an obvious error in your question . Before I can get to the subject of your question , I need to cover some background info . All living organisms are comprised of cells . Cells are rather complicated , but fundamentally are a drop of water(with alot of stuff dissolved in it ) , shielded from the world inside an oil droplet . This oil makes up the ' cell membrane ' and it gives the cell a distinct boundary , and helps the cell hold onto ' what it owns ' or what 's inside that oil wall . Cells need to ' hold onto ' a certain amount of nutrients , and various molecules otherwise they die ; if they lose their cell membrane , they die . That extremely thin wall of oil is of the utmost importance to a cell 's survival . Alcohol , kills things by dissolving their cell membrane , and releasing everything that used to be inside the cell . Normally Oil and water do n't mix , but alcohols serve as middle men , and allows them to get along just fine . There is some cool chemistry involved in that , but it 's a bit past ELI5 I think . Now , a little of alcohol in water is n't going to spontaneously dissolve all the oil in it , or kill any cells it runs into ; you need to get to a higher concentration before this starts happening . That 's why you normally find 75 - 95 % ethanol \/ isopropyl alcohol as a cleaning agent against bacteria , it 's complete overkill and that 's what we like when cleaning . Yeast does n't normally make ethanol actually , it does that as a back up plan . Left alone under normal conditions , yeast actually likes to make carbon dioxide using oxygen . Ethanol is a biproduct of fermentation , which only happens when yeast is oxygen starved , like in a fermentation vat , or a wine bottle . Lets go with the wine bottle for a bit as an example . You throw some yeast in grape juice , and seal it up . The yeast starts using what oxygen is around in order to produce energy so it can survive , and as a byproduct produces Co2 . This keeps going until the oxygen is depleted . Now , at this point the yeast has two options : produce no energy and Die , or start generating energy in a way that does n't require oxygen . Yeast decide to do the second , but this is a ' hail mary play ' as it were because the byproduct of this avenue is ethanol , which once enough of it is produced , will kill the yeast as discussed above . It 's a gamble that oxygen will come back before the yeast makes enough ethanol to kill itself . In wine making , and industry processes , the yeast always dies because we care about the ethanol , not the yeast . Poor yeast ... but on the bright side , you can get up to 20 % ethanol by it 's noble sacrifice ! Jesus allegedly died for your sins ... Millions of Yeast definitely died for that drink . Stay Thirsty my Friends .","Yeast is a fungi not a bacteria .","Why does yeast produce alcohol ? To kill off other microorganisms that might compete with it for food . And , yes , in an environment with enough food , yeast * will * eventually produce enough alcohol to kill themselves off ( or at least shut them down ) .

Specially bred strains used for making moonshine can hit 20 % ."],"2509":["Norman Schwartzkopf ( US General in charge of Desert Shield \/ Desert Storm ) decided on an air campaign to take out the command and control ( c & c ) capabilities of the Iraq military .

They are really , really expensive , and not terribly efficient . Those systems can take 10 - 20 years to generate enough electricity to pay for themselves . Second problem is they do n't scale well . Each individual cell generates its own power , that power than needs to be run down a wire and combined with all of the power generated by each other cell , and this infrastructure to move the power and take the individual small amounts of power and convert them into high voltage AC current to be put into the grid is expensive . We live in a profit driven world and photo voltaic cells just do n't make sense at an industrial scale . However that is not to say the solar has not made major improvements . It has ! And even though you do nt see it every day it is nearly ubiquitous at this point . Its just not fancy looking green photo - voltaic cells that have , it is concentrated solar power(CSP ) systems that have . These systems use mirrors and lenses to magnify the intensity of the sun onto a relatively small point . This small point contains a system that turns heat into steam and turns a steam turbine to create electricity . They are much cheaper at scale because the mirrors and mounting brackets for them do not require the level of manufacture that photo - voltaic does . If solar is ever to take hold at the kind of level required to become the major source of power for the world it is going to be CSP systems that do it , and not photo - voltaic . CSP systems are the only solar solution that can compete with fossil fuels on a price per kWH basis . It was calculated that the entire world power consumption could be met by covering 1 % of the world 's desert climate with CSP . It is also expected that within the next 10 years CSP should be more cost efficient than fossil fuel .","It has made massive improvements .

And as a result , the installed capacity of solar tripled from 2010 - 2012 . So why is n't it ubiquitous ? Several reasons . First , the advances have all been incremental , so there have n't been huge leaps ... just a slow , steady improvement that 's harder to notice . Second , it 's starting from almost nothing installed , so tripling the number from almost nothing , to slightly more than almost nothing still leaves you with little installed capacity . And most installations are done on a site by site basis of panels on the roof of a building . It produces little dribbles of energy here and there , which does n't quickly add up to massive percentages of power used . In short , it just takes time for these kinds of things to spread .","why do you think it should ? we are limited , like every aspect of science is . it 's not like scientist will think \" oh , i need new solar panels \" and there pops up new solar panel . some technologies needs years , or even decades of slow and tedious research . and we did major breaktroughs in last 20 years and price went down pretty substantialy ."],"6347":["They certainly do run into trouble if everyone shows up .

As trade fluctuates so does revenue , and those fluxiations can be dramatic and sudden . Second , they 're counter cyclical - when there is a global recession , taxes go down just when the government wants to increase spending on social safety net programs . Third , it leads to endemic patronage and corruption .

By the end of the nineteenth century there was a sense that the combined effects of the tarrifs and various use and consumption taxes was hurting the 99 % at the expense of the 1 % . The income tax was sold as something that would only be paid by \" rich \" people and that would create jobs as trade increased and lower prices as tarrifs were removed .

Instead , you draw these balloon - shapes orbitals , which are sort of where the electrons are most likely found . In a molecule , these orbitals can overlap , and this overlap causes new hybrid orbitals to form .","Everyone is familiar with the model of an atom where you have a positive nucleus , with negative electrons whizzing around in circles , we call these circles orbitals , where the orbital number goes up the further away from the nucleus you are . An electron can only be located in these orbitals , never between them , think of it like a ladder . You can climb up a ladder , but you only stand on each individual rung . This is , for many things , a good picture . However , we know that it is * not * how things actually look . We know this because physicists are really good at playing the \" if this , then ... \" game . Basically , if electrons were actually in circular orbits around the nucleus , the structure of the atom would n't be stable , and we would n't be here to ask any kind of question ( I can go further into this if you want , but I 'm mostly just trying to provide a backstory for why we have ) . So , what 's a better picture ? Well , the blob shapes that you 've seen \/ dealt with in molecular orbital theory . Here 's why . One of the most fundamental bits of quantum mechanics is something called the Schrodinger Equation ( SE ) . There is a lot of mathematical formalism that I 'll skip over here , but the SE is useful because it allows us to solve , given certain physical conditions , the behaviour of a particle . As a result of the SE , we learn that very small particles do n't behave in the way that say , a baseball would , where we can say \" The pitcher threw the ball , at this speed , and we can track it 's location from here , to here , to here , to ... \" Instead , we learn that tiny things , like electrons , have * probabilities * of being certain places , traveling certain speeds , etc , and when we measure one of those things ( see : Heisenberg uncertainty principle for more ) , we reduce how well we can know the other , because the act of measuring affects the actual thing . Think of it like if you had to measure where a baseball was between where the pitcher threw it and the batter hit it by smacking it with another baseball . Obviously , you would disturb it 's original trajectory , so you could n't know where it would be after you measure it with much certainty . So , physicists start solving the SE for specific things to see how a tiny particle would behave under certain circumstances that are very basic ; the most basic being the particle in the infinite potential well . Imagine a particle , stuck in a deep hole . It can bounce around , have more \/ less energy , but ca n't escape the hole . Let 's imagine that this is a very tiny particle now , so that we are dealing with the SE . Well , if we solve the SE we find that the particle can have different energy levels ( again , think rungs on a ladder ; so the particle can exist in different heights from the bottom of the hole ) . Our solutions to the SE are waves ( sine , cosine ) . When use follow the rules of probability theory and Born 's rule ( which is a rule about how we measure probabilities in quantum mechanics ) we can find that we can calculate the probability of [ where the particle is in our well ] ( URL_0 ) , given different energy levels . The peaks of the graphs represent the most likely place , while the nodes are zero probability . Eventually , physicists solve the SE for the specific set of circumstances that an electron would have if bound to a proton ; e.g. \" in orbit around a proton \" if you are still thinking in the orbital \/ planetary picture of an atom . An electron going around a proton ? Well , that 's a hydrogen atom . So , when the SE was solved for the hydrogen atom , in three dimensions , physicists could solve for the different energy levels ( orbital levels ) of the electron . This would be like the graph above , where there are areas of high probability , lower probability , and no probability ( like the space between orbitals , where the electron is not allowed ) . This graph though is more complicated because we have three dimensions now instead of one dimension . The \" blobs \" give you the areas where there is a probability of finding an electron , and , like the particle in a well , different energy levels ( n=1,2 , ... ) give differently shaped solutions . These arise because the solutions to the Hydrogen atom are a specific set of equations called spherical harmonics [ that give rise to solutions that look like this ] ( URL_1 ) . For atoms other than hydrogen , the system gets too complicated to solve in closed form , except for specific cases where an atom can sort of look like a hydrogen atom ( like if all the electrons have been stripped away except one ) . * However * physicists ( and chemists ! ) are a bunch of pretty smart guys , and take these solutions to qualitatively ( and sometimes quantitatively ) analyze a system . Bonding between atoms ( depending on the type of bond being formed ) happen when energy levels get crossed between atoms ; which happens in fairly specific ways , with some being more common than others because they are more energetically favourable . These blobs correspond to different \" strengths \" or bonding energies ( sigma , pi bonds ... ) . Chemists and physicists characterize the energy levels \/ shells by how they get filled with electrons . This is your 1s , 2p , etc . The rules of quantum mechanics , and solutions to the SE give you these different energy levels or \" shells . \" Even though it is * very * difficult ( or impossible ? ) to solve the SE for high Z atoms and molecules , we can solve ( sometimes numerically ) for these things by assuming certain forms of solutions ( the different blobs ) and knowing how likely things are to happen , and exploiting symmetries . These are the ( sometimes complicated ) rules that chemists know for how molecular bonding happens . Let me know if you have any more questions . I 'm decent at the physics , less familiar with the chemistry side ( it was a while ago that I had those classes ) . If others want to add \/ correct me on anything , please do . What I 've posted is my understanding of what OP asked , and does n't necessarily mean it 's 100 % correct , and the interpretation can sometimes be misguided .","OK , well basically , electrons like to gather in groups , called Orbitals . These groups are separated by the amount of electrons in them and the shape they make . for example , a P - orbital has a total of six electrons inside it . These orbitals can be further divided into sub - orbitals , which have to electrons in , with opposite spins ( lets not go into what spin is , because frankly I do n't quite know , but IO do have a good analogy for the spin notation if you want to hear it . ) . These sub orbitals are shaped in certain ways . EG in a P - orbital each sub orbital makes a kind of dumbell \/ hourglass shape . What its important to understand with these orbitals , is that they are just fields where an electron is likely to be . electrons can exist anywhere within them , and can sometimes exist without them . They are just where the probability of the electron being there is high . Does this sound confusing ? Because , to be honest , it should . Electrons are buggers when it comes to understanding them properly ."],"9542":["Steam is just a content distributor - they work with publishers to negotiate how sale prices will work .

Steam gets $ 5,000 out of that 1 $ title in fees . The publisher gets a lot of visibility out of a steam sale , and marketing is a factor - a 50 % discount on a game might eat into their profit from sale , but the marketing \/ advertising gained might more than make up that 50 % loss .

You can hear this difference in Bernstein 's [ America ] ( URL_1 ) from West Side Story : The bit that goes \" * I * like to * live * in A-*me*-*ri*-*ca * \" . Note how The first half has two accents ( \" I \" and \" live \" ) and is in 6\/8 , and the second half is 3\/4 with emphasis on \" me \" , \" ri \" , \" ca \" .","Its not always about the ratio , its mostly about where you want the emphasis to be and how fast that beat goes . Also keep in mind that in many 20th century arrangements composers will stick in measures with different time signatures to produce a certain effect , and those measures do n't always behave the same as if an entire piece were written in that meter . Some time signatures are close to interchangeable . 2\/4 is often really similar to 2\/2 or \" cut \" time even though those are n't the same ratio as 2\/4 .

Others are not . 3\/4 is 3 beats per measure , each beat being subdivided into 2 , while 6\/8 is 2 beats subdivided into 3 . 6\/4 can mean a few things . If an entire piece is written in 6\/4 , it probably is in a slow 3 . But if a random measure is in a piece , it may just represent a 4\/4 + a 2\/4 measure to extend a phrase by a couple of beats . In addition to 2 vs 3 feel , the composer arranger will take other things into account , like how much work would the conductor be doing , and how much effort is to write everything out . Going back to 2\/4 vs cut time , the advantage of 2\/2 is that really fast notes can be written as 16th notes instead of 32nd notes . That makes it easier to read and easier to write .","The main difference is a combination of which notes get emphasized , how the notes are distributed in the measure , and what kind of music is traditionally played in that time signature . 2\/2 with emphasizing every other beat , divide each measure into two parts , and have a march - like quality . 4\/4 emphasized every fourth beat , and you might see a quarter note - half note - quarter note order you would be unlikely to see in 2\/2 . Similarly , 3\/4 is usually a waltz 1 - 2 - 3 , a measure 's rhythm would rarely be divided between two dotted quarter notes .

And the great thing about understanding your bad mental patterns is that once you understand them , you can start work on breaking \/ changing them . For example , some people with anxiety will also assume the worst in any given situation . Even if the worst is very very unlikely , they hyperfocus on that and then not do certain things just because something that has a very very small chance of happening might happen . A therapist can help you understand why you do this , what you are so afraid of , but also can help you look at things more realistically and can help you face your fears . With many anxiety disorders you do need to do a certain amount of bucking up and doing what makes you terrified until it does n't anymore . A therapist can help you with that because they can accompany you , help you break down the problem in little steps that you can tackle , they can make plans with you and keep you accountable for those plans . Similarly with social anxieties many people have that those bad mental pathways where they already assume someone else will think in a certain way . A therapist can help you break through that .

It was scientific in the sense that they were doing genuine studies and recording their data and all that , but they had a very clear bias , which makes it fundamentally unscientific .

I recently took heed to them after my fianc\u00e9 put an article in front of me and pointed out that my favourite drink might have actually been the cause of my struggles for years . I gave the drink up . This is my story:- As someone who had drank Diet Coke for nearly every single drink ( apart from the occasional cup of tea ) for the past 14 years it was very much part of my life . I have over the years had a great deal of issue with my weight . I always thought I was fat when I was younger ( I was pretty normal ) and so by the age of twenty I had developed an eating disorder . I would restrict my eating , dieting regularly , and drinking Diet Coke to keep me full . At first I would eat very nutritionally balanced meals , with a small deficit in calorie intake , of Vegetables , small pieces of protein and some unrefined carbs , but even when full I still wanted more and my weight loss was n't enough . What was a mild diet converted into an eating disorder which soon developed into full on bulimia which very quickly spiralled into cycles of over eating and craving food from morning to night . I was obsessed with food . I drank litres of Diet Coke to fill me and ensure my calorie count was low . I would drink it at breakfast , lunch and dinner ; if I was out on a night out , at yoga class or at the cinema , in fact I would drink it whenever possible . I did n't see this as a problem but more a taste option . As people around me would drink coffee and drinks higher in caffeine or calories I thought that my penchant for DCoke was pretty ok . I 've never been a water fan and it helped me to get my liquids down , I felt comfortable with how low calorie it was , so that was good by me . My weight however and cravings for food escalated disproportionately to the amount I ate or sometimes did n't eat . To lose any weight I 'd have to barely eat at all restricting calories down to a minimum . When I allowed myself to eat however I was a literal bottomless pit . I blamed this on having restricted my diet for so long and that my metabolism must have slowed down so much that it craved food all the time . The Speed of weight gain increased when I started eating normally once more . I entered a happy and successful relationship and began to eat regular meals which were balanced . I gained weight consistently and quickly , but I put it down to the damamge to my metabolism and it adjusting to the new intake . This is a reasonable thing to assume . I believe that it is partly true , but My appetite when full was insatiable and I could eat 4 - 5 large bowls of pasta at one sitting . This was an appetite I 'd never had beforez I Ate til I felt sick and craving high sugar and high fat food . My weight went up and up until I had gained 3 stone and my doctor told me I was in the overweight category . At this point I was still drinking Diet Coke at every moment possible . This brings me to 2 months ago when I gave up Diet Coke and it is one of the hardest things I 've ever done . I read an article shown to me by my partner and decided to prove him wrong in his blaming of Diet Coke for my appetitite problems and weight gain . I did n't want to give up Diet Coke for good . I love it . Still do . It was hell at first . I still ca n't see a can of it without getting cravings and it makes me shake and edgy to see it . The first week of giving up Diet Coke I lost half a stone without even noticing . My stomach was no longer bloated and I was no longer as gassy . My appetite has disappeared . I 've now on the way to my normal BMI , losing weight every day , and I no longer crave sugary foods . I feel full without over eating and leave food on the plate . I have lost over a stone without any effort at all . Previously it was a struggle to not want more and more food straight after eating . Now I am struggling to eat a full plate . I can see now that Diet Coke has played a massive part in my struggles with my weight for years because of the food cravings it caused and I honestly blame it for my bulimia . If I had stayed away from it my weight loss would have been natural and gradual . I needed to write this if it will help anyone else who may become a victim to it . There is nothing Diet about Diet Coke ."],"2207":["It is n't complicated , but I think a video works best for explaining how clutches work : URL_0 Sorry for the add , it 's a pretty good explanation .","You have two outer metal plates , and a third inner plate squashed between them . The two outer metal plates are connected to , and spin with , the engine . The inner plate is connected to the transmission input shaft . The outer metal plates are called the \" flywheel \" and the \" pressure plate \" . The flywheel bolts directly to the crankshaft at the back of the engine . Whenever the engine spins the flywheel does too . The pressure plate is then bolted directly onto the flywheel . Trapped inbetween them , but not bolted to either , is the clutch disc . Inside the pressure plate there 's a \" pressure disc \" and some form of spring . Normally , the spring presses the pressure disc against the clutch disc . Which in turn presses the clutch disc against the flywheel . The clutch disc has brakepad - like stuff riveted to it , so when it presses against the spinning flywheel , friction causes it to spin too . Since the clutch disc is connected to the transmission input shaft , this also turns the transmission and eventually the wheels . To sum up so far : The spring(s ) in the pressure plate press the pressure disc against the clutch disc , and consequently the clutch disc against the flywheel . This transfers the spinning motion of the engine \/ flywheel to the clutch disc . The clutch disc is attached to the transmission input shaft , which turns the transmission . Now the $ 64,000 question - what happens when you press down the clutch pedal ? How do the plates disengage , so the engine is n't spinning the transmission ? There 's multiple ways to do this , but all of them boil down to the same thing : They pull the spring(s ) back , so the spring(s ) * do n't * press the pressure disc against the clutch disc . And hence , the clutch disc is not pressed against the flywheel . The engine can spin , but the clutch disc is n't pressed against it and so does n't have to . Hence , no power to the transmission . Some pressure plates use a \" diaphragm spring \" , which acts a lot like a bunch of spring - loaded levers . The spring - loaded levers normally push the pressure disc against the clutch disc . But you can push on the levers to make them back the spring off . [ Here 's what that looks like . ] ( URL_1 ) Other pressure plates have actual coil springs that press the pressure disc against the clutch plate . And an actual lever that pulls the pressure disc back . [ Like so . ] ( URL_0 ) In either case , there 's a \" throwout bearing \" on the transmission shaft . This is what controls the lever(s ) . The bearing can slide forward or backward on the shaft^1 , and thus cause the levers to either press the flywheel and clutch plate together or not . The clutch pedal is connected to the throwout bearing by a cable , hydraulics , or some other way . And that 's how clutches work . ----- ^1 Me gusta !","5 year old version : The clutch kit is basically a set of discs that , when pressed , disconnect the motor from the transmission , allowing the shift from one gear to the next ."],"16776":["It 's simple , they do n't .

A dynamical system is a set of values that interact and change over time according to some set of fixed rules . The values could be the locations of planets , or measurements of pressure in a liquid , or number of people waiting in each line at a supermarket . The rules often are expressed in terms of \" differential equations \" . These are equations that relate the values to the speed at which the values are changing . Differential equations is a giant field of mathematics , and if you make it past calculus they 'll be waiting there for you . A dynamical system model is a simplified version of reality expressed in terms of math . For instance , when you model the motion of the solar system , you typically ignore the effects of gravity from distant stars . These models try to get all the relevant information and throw away anything that wo n't cause much of an effect . Orthogonal = perpendicular . As in , two roads at a stop sign meet orthogonally . This extends to higher dimensions as well . For instance , you could have two orthogonal planes in 3 - space , or you could have two orthogonal 3 - dimensional spaces in 4 - space . State space = the set of all possibilities for your set of values . This is typically a space that has the same dimension as the number of variables . For instance , if you were to look at the state space of the solar system , you would need 3 position and 3 velocity values at any given time for each planet . 9 planets ( PLUTO IS A PLANET , DAMMIT ) plus the sun mean that you would need a 60 dimensional space . * * In this 60 dimensional space , you could sum up the current state of the solar system with a single point . * * So , the evolution of a system over time can be represented as a point moving through a high dimensional space . Now , if you were to map all possible motions of this point through this space , you might start to see interesting patterns . For instance , you might see that if the point is in one part of the space , it will trace an orbital path around a point . This is a rotation . The speed at which this happens is its frequency . There can be many such rotations with different centers and different speeds , and the planes of rotation can be perpendicular . That would be what is happening in your sentence . Please feel free to ask more questions .","Your model is a bit more confusing than a simple answer . In brief , it is how a rule ( a function , like f(x ) = x^2 ) changes over time . What you do is iterate the function . With the example of x^2 , you could do something like this : x0 = .5 x1 = f(x0)=f(.5)=.25 x2 = f(x1)=f(f(x0))=.0625 etc . Usually , it is dependent on time ( t ) and the output represents geometric space . I.e. , you could have a 3 - dimensional function with respect to time and you see how the point \" moves around \" in that space . With the above example , it is easy to see that if your starting point is < 1 , it will converge to 0 , and if it is greater than 1 , it will diverge to infinity . Also , sometimes things bounce back and forth and get caught in what is called an orbit . Look at sin(pi*n ) . This will bounce between -1 and 1 , so it does not converge nor diverge .

Typically they block or repress the function of some essential cellular component ( typically an enzyme \/ protein ) . Drugs are able to interact with these cellular parts because they have a shape that fits like a puzzle piece into its target . Mutation is a natural process . When a bacterium is ready to reproduce it makes a copy of its chromosome(s ) ( made of DNA and consisting of genes ) and divides into two daughter cells . This copying process is very accurate , but NOT perfect . Some cells in a growing population of bacteria will have mutations that were not found in their ancestors . Some of these mutations may occur in gene that codes for cellular parts that are drug targets . When a mutation occurs in one of these genes it may alter the site on a protein where drugs bind . The two will no longer fit together like puzzle pieces and the drug will not work or will be less effective . Other mutations may help cells deal with drugs in different ways . Enzymes may gain new functions that can cause them to expel or break down drugs . Another important thing to know is that bacteria \" have sex . \" They can exchange pieces of DNA with one another or uptake DNA from their environment left over by dead cells . Some of this transferred DNA may contain genes that confer antibiotic resistance . When drugs are administered to a population of bacteria , most of them will be killed but if any resistant mutants were in the population they now have the opportunity to grow and reproduce and all of their surviving descendants will contain their genes for antibiotic resistance because they are essentially making a bunch of clones of themselves . There is much debate going on about the best way to deal with wide - spread antibiotic resistance . We are in this situation because bacteria evolve faster than our ability to design and commercialize new drugs . Many scientists would say we need to use antibiotics less often , especially in livestock . Others want to find new combinations of drugs that work synergistically with one another . Multiple approaches will likely need to be used to deal with these issues .","There are actually several types of drugs that attack bacteria ( antibiotics ) . Each type targets a specific part of the bacteria to kill it . Pretty much all of these drugs actually come from bacteria though , since bacteria have been trying to kill each other for a few billion years . Humans have found a few species of bacteria that produce chemicals that are good at killing bacteria but bad at killing humans , since our cells are different . We refine these chemicals to make antibiotics . Because this bacterial civil war has been going on for billions of years though , bacteria have evolved defenses . The simplest defense is simply to have a system that pumps the antibiotic out of the bacterium fast enough that it does n't have time to work ( think pumping water out of a leaky boat ) . Bacteria have also evolved systems that bind to the antibiotic . This makes the drug unable to attach to its target ( think chaff confusing guided missiles ) . Another way to resist antibiotics is for the bacteria to change the target . Antibiotics aim for very specific parts of the cell , so even a minor change can cause resistance ( think of changing a lock ) . Now , all these systems cost energy , which bacteria would rather use for other things , like reproduction . So bacteria in environments that do n't have threats from antibiotics tend to not have these traits . Strains grown in labs , for instance , slowly lose antibiotic resistance . In any given colony of bacteria though , a few might have these traits , maybe 1 % or something ( to pick an arbitrary number ) . When you take an antibiotic , you kill off the susceptible bacteria , but the resistant ones survive and now have room to thrive . Think of having a garden with tulips and roses . A disease comes and wipes out all the tulips , but leaves the roses . The garden is still there and soon it will be filled with roses . Of course , it gets even worse , because bacteria can actually swap genes . This is called \" horizontal transfer . \" Basically , imagine next to your now rose - filled garden , you have a garden of lilies . Once the resistant - roses meet the susceptible - lilies , they become resistant - lilies . How do we fight this ? There are a few ways : * * * Bacteria can be resistant , but rarely immune , to antibiotics . * * With high repeated doses , even the toughest bacteria can be killed . This is why doctors and nurses always tell you take ALL of your antibiotics . With very resistant bacteria , however , the doses might need to be so high they might actually cause more harm to the person than good . * * * Do n't pass around bacteria , do n't get sick . * * The first thing any health professional does when they enter a patient 's room should be to disinfect their hands . That should also be the last thing they do as well . This is basically quarantining the resistant bacteria . * * * Make new drugs . * * This is problematic , since we found all the easy chemicals decades ago . In fact , starting in the 60s , research into making new antibiotics basically stopped . It was n't until about 10 years ago that new types of antibiotics started to be discovered . These will face the same problems of bacteria developing resistance though . * * * Try combinations of drugs . * * Bacterial strains may have resistance to one or more types of drugs . By combining different classes you can attack the bacteria on multiple fronts . Still , this could lead to the growth of even more resistant bacteria if not used properly , and may have deadly side effects to the patient . * * * Infect the bacteria ! * * There are certain types of viruses , called \" bacteriophages \" ( or just phages ) , that infect and kill bacteria , but ignore humans . There are also some bacteria that eat other bacteria ( * Bdellovibrio * spp . is the main one we know of ) . By dosing a patient with live cultures of these organisms , you can essentially use them to kill of the bacteria causing an infection . Bacteria can still develop resistance to these therapies , but it 's generally easier to alter a phage to make it work again than it is to alter an antibiotic . The downside is that these \" living antibiotics \" tend to be somewhat specific in what they target , doctors already need to kind of know what they 're fighting . Also , your body relies on helpful bacteria to do things like digest food . You need to use a phage - dose that kills the harmful bacteria , but leaves the helpful bacteria alone . Finally , it has to be a dose of live phages , so easy and convenient pills are out . Still , phage therapy is neat . The USSR actually used to be leaders in phage therapy , mostly because they could n't get antibiotics reliably from the West . * edit : Grammar !","Its been a while since I was in school , but here we go : Mutation comes from errors in copying DNA . Each time a new bacteria is produced , its DNA is slightly different from its mother bacteria . Most of the time the error is neutral , resulting in no change in function , or deleterious , resulting in a mutation that harms or kills the bacteria . Every so often the error in DNA results in a beneficial mutation like a slightly higher tolerance to cold . So lets say we have a drug that targets sodium channels in bacteria . The drug functions to block or inhibit the channel in some way , so that the bacteria ca n't regulate its sodium levels and causes it to die . Yay we can kill this strain of bacteria with our drug . However , in the millions of bacteria that are all huddled together and reproducing , there is a chance that the code in the DNA to build the sodium channel is mutated and produces a slightly differently shaped sodium channel . The channel still transports sodium , but its shape no longer matches the drug , and the drug does n't work anymore . That lone bacteria can now survive against the drug , while its siblings are all dieing . Without competition from its siblings , the new \" resistant \" bacteria thrives . That s the basic gist of it . It gets a bit more complicated with gene transference and sex bridges . How do we beat it ? That is tough to answer . The majority of our anti - bacterial drugs are mimics of nature , such as the ever popular Penicillin . Drugs targeting bacteria need to be bacteria specific so they do n't harm humans . Essentially we have to find some way to deliver a killing blow without harming ourselves . Stuff that is kill a bullet to the head to bacteria is pretty much a bullet to the head to our own cells ."],"5444":["Because they are not the same , or even really close to it . Circumcision removes the foreskin , but the penis is still full functional . You still have the ability to urinate and ejaculate . The equivalency to female surgery is to a female circumcision which is a trimming of the clitoral hood . This is actually legal most places . FGM which is the damaging or removal of the clitoris , removal of the labia , or full removal of the clitoral hood is what is illegal . The equivalent would be the removal of the penis head .","I think its important to clarify something before I answer . Severe grades of MGM and FGM are both banned equally . You can not order a penile subincision on your newborn . You are n't allowed to have their foreskin pinned shut . Just as you are n't allowed to have the labia majora \/ minora removed from your newborn or cut off the clitoris . All of these are very severe forms of \" circumcision \" which are \/ were practised to some degree in various parts of the worlld . In FGM , removal of the clitoral hood or even making a small \" nick \" off of the clitoris are both illegal . However a form of MGM , circumcision as we know it , is still legal . The reasons for this are multifactorial , primarily however it comes down to a difference of culture . ~~Christianity ( to a lesser extent ) and Judaism both dictate MALE circumcision~~ Christianity inspired individuals such as John Harvey Kellogg to attempt to prevent masturbation in men and boys , believing it to be Sin , however Christianity itself does not prescribe Circumcision directly . Judaism however directly dictates circumcision . These two faiths happen to be more predominant in the west than they are in the Middle East and North \/ Central Africa whilst Islam dictates both MALE and FEMALE circumcision and is of course more predominant in these regions ( plus some areas of South East Asia ) . It is no coincidence that FGM is extraordinarily high among Islamic populations in various countries , even in those which have it as illegal .

Boxing and MMA do n't have contracts with those stations ( mainly because they are considered worth it for the major stations ) so they do PPV .

The NBA is similar since there are so many timeouts and the MLB is predictable with its innings so it can go to commercial multiple times . The NHL is n't as popular in the USA .

It 's totally off the mark of what it is in reality and what the general public thinks it is . It was nicknamed this because of a book by the same name , but the book was suppose to be called the Goddamn Particle . The publisher felt that it was too racy of a name , so they called it The God Particle . Back in the 60 's , physicists were exploring the inside of atoms to figure out how the whole universe worked . Over time , they figured out a few things here and there and they started fitting them together , much like a puzzle . They called their current working model of all physics the Standard Model . The Higgs Boson is what give an object mass ( how much space in the universe it occupies ) * . It is literally the last part of the Standard Model that been predicted but have not yet been found . It 's important because if we do n't find the boson , the whole Standard Model will literally collapse upon itself and the last hundred or so years of quantum mechanic research will have been for naught . * * As to how it work :* * invisible , non - existanal particles ( boson in this case ) are always popping in and out of existence all the time . Some of these particles will react strongly to a force , such as a magnet , and will create a field of density around a point . This is why magnets can hold onto a refrigerator when touching , but ca n't when 2 feet away . These particles are responsible for the two bits of metal holding onto each other . Physicist can test whether or not these forces can actually influence our world ( like magnetism ) by dumping a lot of energy into a controlled environment . Because matter is convertible to energy ( E = MC^2 ) , we can visualize matter as a sort of frozen ice cube of energy which we can melt or freeze matter with the right application of energy . What they 're doing at CERN is dumping a huge amount of energy into a system to essentially force the invisible particles into existence , not unlike how pumping a huge amount of gas into an air tank turns it into liquid . If the theoretical Higgs Boson pop into existence at CERN , it 'll prove that a field ( like a magnet ) is what cause bits of matter to have more or less mass than other bits of matter . But instead of being focused on a single point ( like a magnetic rock ) the Higgs Field should stretch out across the universe evenly and interact with everything in existence . Some particles of matter will take up X amount of space and others will take up Y amount , and no matter where you are in the universe you 'll alway have that amount of mass occupying space . As to why it 's only now we 're about to discover the Higgs , it 's purely because nobody has built a big enough environment capable of holding the energy needed force the Boson into existence .

Mass in space has no weight but is dependent on the acceleration of bodies around each other . It 's actually possible for a single point in space to have a ridicules amount of weight despite it have very little mass . Most of what I 've written still stands , but consider the problem of the Higgs Field like this : light is unique for having no mass , thus allowing it to travel at a tremendous speed and being unmolested by the Field . A rock in space ( a vacuum and for argument 's stake with nil gravitational forces ) will never travel nearly as fast because it has mass and will interact with the Higgs Field much more . A planet will be bogged down even more so because it has a huge amount of mass . If we found a planet composed of nothing but Higgs Bosons , it 'll never move simply because every particle of the planet is interacting with the Field and is stuck right were it is .","To add to other answers - it 's a little above ELI5 level , but I found [ this video ] ( URL_0 ) really helpful in visualising the Higgs boson giving mass to other stuff .

The reactions in the center of a sun 's core is crushing atoms together till they transition to different elements . A sun begins to go super nova when the core reaches iron production .

At the point of super nova , the sun explodes violently and the formation of elements such as gold and platinum are shot out across the cosmos . If the star is large enough , it leaves behind a neutron star , incredibly dense matter . A teaspoon of which weighs around 100,000 tons . Black holes form when a super massive star begins to die , the reaction reaches a point where the exploding energy ca n't escape the gravity generated by the center of the star and it becomes a singularity . Neutron stars do n't have enough gravitational force to become a black hole , as the particles that are pulled back by gravity escape the star 's poles as a gamma ray burst .","Firstly our sun is a star and everything starts from here . Have you seen an explosion before ? Well , this is essentially what a star is : lots of heated stuff flying away from where the explosion was started . In space a sun is a very long lasting explosion that keeps going because there is so much stuff to explode . The sun does n't explode past a certain size due to a force called gravity . Without going into do much depth gravity is what holds planets and stars together and squishes everything in them towards the middle . The bigger they are the harder this squeeze is . If you notice when an explosion on earth finishes it gets smaller and looks to fall back to earth . It is gravity that causes this to happen and this is very similar to what happens when a sun supernovas . It 's the explodable stuff within a star that exploding that stops all of the stuff in a star from being taken over by gravity and being crushed into a little ball . Once this explodable stuff is used up this is exactly what begins to happen . Gravity takes over quickly and the ball that is the star compresses into a small space very quickly . However , this raises an interesting question : why does the star then explode ? Well , think of it that a star is made up of lots of little springs . There is only so far you can squeeze them together quickly before they rebound . The more and faster you squeeze , the harder it seems to hold the spring in place . Try squeeze on a spring really fast and you will see what I mean . The spring in the context of our star is the force that holds the electron away from the protons and neutrons that it orbit . So that explains the supernova . But what about a neutron star . Imagine gravity was strong enough to hold the all of the springs together as close as they can be , with so many springs there is going to be a lot of force wanting to spring out in this situation . What you end up with is a very fast spinning tight and powerful mix of springs . With all this force within springs can be violently ejected from the north and south pole of this violent spinning beast . In the context of atoms all the space between the protons , nutrons and electrons is squished as far as they can be together and gravity is strong enough to mostly keep them there . Black holes are where it gets really weird . You see gravity also bends space . Go into your bedroom and with a few friends pull a bed sheet taught and put a football ( soccer ball ) onto it . You will notice the sheet gradually dips in to accommodate for the football . Now if you were to roll a marball along the sheet you would see it follow the curve that has been created in this sheet . This is pretty much how gravity works in space and is why our moon orbits our sun . But why does this relate to a black hole ? Imagine you had a really heavy metal ball - bearing and this time you stretched out some cling film to put it on . The well created by the ball would become so deep that if you rolled the marball too close the it would almost always fall into the well that the ball sits in . This is exactly what happens with a black hole and the point where it is impossible to roll through that is furthest away from the ball is something called its event horizon . We do n't actually know what it is like past this point as its well is so deep that not even light is able to escape it .

Get a picture of a large event where you can see for a long distance within the frame of the picture . See how in the picture you posted you can see many cars close up and also many cars far away ? That 's a good picture to start with ! 2 . Without going into too much technical detail , using a photo editor program you blur just the top and bottom of the picture using a gradient . This means that the top and bottom of the picture will be most blurry and as you get to the center the picture gets less blurry . Congratulations , you just made a tilt - shift picture ! Now , why does it make things look miniature ? Well , this has to do with how your eyes look at small objects . Let 's do a little experiment . Get three little toys and put them on your desk , so that one toy is in front , one toy is in back about 6 inches away , and the last toy is even further back , about another 6 inches away . Now get down towards desk level and close one eye and focus the other eye on the middle toy . You should notice that when you 're focusing on the middle toy the toy in front and the toy in back are blurry . This is because the way your eyes and most camera lenses work , when you 're looking at things relatively close to you ( less than about 1 - 3 feet away ) , the lens in your eye that helps you focus can only focus on a narrow strip at the distance you are focusing . So when you are focusing on the middle toy , only the things that are that toy 's distance away from your eye will be in focus , and everything else in front of and behind the toy will be blurry . This is called * * narrow depth of field * * , meaning that when you are focusing on something close to you , you can only focus on a * * narrow * * strip at the certain * * depth * * ( aka distance from your eye ) of the object you 're looking at in your * * field * * of view . So how does this tie into tilt - shift pictures ? Well basically all these pictures are just mimicking what your eye does when it is looking at small objects close up . The cars closest to the camera ( the ones at the bottom of the picture ) , and the cars farthest from the camera ( the ones at the top of the picture ) , are made blurry because they are in front of or behind the depth at which the camera is \" focusing \" ( remember in real life that the camera took a picture of real , life - sized objects from very far away so it was basically able to focus on everything all at once ) . But , once you treat the picture with the blurring effects , then your brain perceives the picture as if it was taken by a camera up close to toy - sized objects ! I hope that explanation helped !","First , you take a photo of something , as if you were looking down upon it at 45 degree angle .

Last thing is that you apply degrees of blur to things closer and further away from whatever is in the middle of the shot .

Hardest part is getting the right angle , of the right things .

The particular sequence of amino acids in a protein determines the shape it will bend itself into , which determines what it will do . For example , some proteins are the perfect shape to grab two other molecules and smush them together so that they get combined ( these proteins are called enzymes ) . Other proteins are the perfect shape to carry important molecules ( like hemoglobin , which is a protein that carries oxygen around your blood ) . Your DNA is also a long chain of molecules , but these molecules are called * nucleotides * . There are four main nucleotides that make up the chain , and each is represented by a letter ( A , C , T , and G ) . The sequence of \" letters \" in DNA contains all the information to make proteins in your body . Scientists represent DNA by writing out the sequence of \" letters , \" like ATCTGCCATCCCGT . Now here 's the important bit : these letters are arranged in 3 - letter words that \" mean \" an amino acid . For example , \" ATC \" in DNA corresponds with an amino acid called glutamine . A long chain of these three letter words will match perfectly the chain of amino acids in a protein . So if a protein has amino acids 1 , 2 , and 3 , the DNA corresponding to that protein will have the 3 - letter words that mean amino acids 1 , 2 , and 3 in order . A sequence of DNA that matches a protein is called a * gene * . When it 's time to make a protein , your body unravels the DNA and makes a copy of the gene on a different , very similar molecule called messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . This copying is called * transcription*--like you 're transcribing your notes from your notebook to your computer . This mRNA flies out to a thing in your cells called a * ribosome * , which actually goes through and READS the RNA sequence and attaches amino acids in the right order . So it will go \" okay , these 3 letters mean this amino acid , the next 3 letters mean this amino acid , etc . \" and just attach all the amino acids in a row . * So you end up with a long long chain ( hundreds , even thousands ! ) of amino acids in the exact sequence of the DNA letters that you had originally . This process of matching DNA \" words \" to amino acids is called * translation*--like you 're translating from the \" language \" of DNA to the \" language \" of proteins \/ amino acids . This long chain of amino acids then detaches itself from the ribosome , folds itself up , and voila ! You have a protein ! This is happening millions of times constantly all around your body as all your cells make all the proteins they need to function . Now in reality , it 's actually a lot more complicated than that -- the DNA is n't always in the right order , the protein can get \" cut \" and shaped by other things after it detaches , etc . But this is the basic process and is what you need to know ! PS Here 's a pretty cool animation of the whole process : URL_0 * There are actually two other kinds of RNA that work in this process . Ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) makes up the structure of the ribosome . Transfer RNA ( tRNA ) holds the amino acids and attaches them in the right order . You might have to know that for your exam .","Alright , so you know that the DNA sequence is made up of 4 nucleotides ( A , G , C , T ) . You know that A - T pair up , and C - G pair up . Getting from DNA to proteins happens via two processes known as transcription and translation . Transcription happens when a specific sequence of DNA is taken and * transcribed * to RNA . RNA is very similar to DNA . It 's made up of 4 nucleotides ( A , G , C , U ) . Notice that there are no T 's in RNA ... they're all replaced by Uracil ( U ) . What happens is that the enzyme RNA polymerase \" selects \" the sequence it wants to transcribe . This part gets a little tricky to explain via text , but I 'll have a go at it : If you have a sequence of DNA , for example 5 ' -- ATGTCTCGA -- 3 ' [ Call it strand A ] 3 ' -- TACAGAGCT -- 5 ' [ Call it strand B ] You notice that the two strands are complimentary . If I want to make a copy of strand A , then all I have to do is make a compliment of strand B. That is what RNA polymerase does . If it wants to take strand A and turn it into RNA ( specifically , mRNA ) , then it goes along strand * * B * * and makes a compliment , except with U 's instead of T 's . The result is a single - stranded RNA molecule , with a sequence identical to strand A. This \" pre - mRNA \" molecule is modified in some ways to protect it from digestion and for signalling purposes . Some sections of it are also removed completely . After all this is said and done , it moves out of the nucleus and into the cell cytoplasm where it can be * * translated * * into proteins . At this point , we 're introduced to the idea of \" codons \" and \" anticodons \" . A codon is simply a triplet of nucleotides in the DNA sequence . So going back to strand A , the codons are : ATG , TCT , and CGA . An anticodon is simply the compliment to a codon . So , the anticodon to ATG is TAC . The mechanism behind translation is that you have codons on your mRNA , and tRNA molecules with anticodons complimentary to the mRNA codons . tRNA molecules are also made up of RNA , they have specific sequenes , with specific anticodons , and bind to specific amino acids . Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins . Translation is hard as fuck to explain without visualization for me , so I 'll just simplify it as much as I can . Your mRNA goes into a ribosome , and each codon signals a tRNA molecule with the appropriate anticodon , carrying a specific amino acid to come and bind . You do this for each codon , as the mRNA goes through . As you 're doing this , the amino acids are brought together , and so they 're slowly forming a chain ( polypeptide chain ) . This keeps happening until a stop codon is reached in the mRNA . A stop codon is one for which there is no tRNA molecule with the appropriate anticodon . Nothing can bind . The whole thing falls apart , the mRNA is released , the polypeptide is released , and all is dandy . The polypeptide can then be folded by other specialized enzymes called chaperones and modified , added to metal complexes , whatever the fuck ( the possibilities are endless ) , until it becomes a fully functional protein .","DNA unfolds -- > mRNA copies unfolded DNA -- > Ribosomes read DNA -- > tRNA adds amino acids to a growing chain which produces the protein .

The amortization formula comes up wit a number that means \" If you pay exactly $ X for each and every payment over the N years of the loan , at this interest rate , it will all come out even . \" The last payment is often off by a few dollars , but close enough . Once the amortization formula comes up with that number , the rest is straightforward . Take your current outstanding principal balance , figure out one month 's worth of interest , and that 's the amount of the monthly payment going to interest . The remaining part of the $ X is used to reduce the principal balance . Next month , they do the same calculation , but since the principal balance has gone down , the one month 's worth of interest is also smaller , but the $ X payment amount remains the same . Adding to the confusion is escrow , usually for taxes and insurance . This changes each year , which means your total monthly payment can change each year . But the part of the payment that goes to principal plus interest is always the same . The could , if they wanted and you wanted , change things so that the principal amount was the same each and every month , and the principal went down .

But in case OP was wondering what makes C major a major scale and A minor a minor scale : It 's a little less objective , but usually a melody written in a certain scale will ' feel ' anchored to the root of the scale . So while C major and A minor have the same group of notes , a melody ' anchored ' around C would more likely be in C major , etc . It gets even more obvious when you consider the chords . At a very basic level , the chords starting from the 1st , 4th , and 5th notes of a scale are most prominent . So a song with a lot of C , F , and G chords would most likely be C major , etc . Finally , it is possible to write somewhat ambiguous melodies or chords that do n't fit nicely into either paradigm . For example , certain blues scales or the \" Hendrix chord \" : URL_0 This chord has intervals that would seem to make it both major and minor at the same time .

It 's similar to looking through choppy water .","the heat ( from fire or a hot engine ) affects the air in between you and the thing you 're observing ( the object being distorted ) . The heat - source will heat up the air in front of you and as a result change the density of the air gas in between you ( the observer ) and the object being distorted . Light is an electromagnetic wave and travels best in a complete vacuum ( a medium with absolutely no molecules of any kind to slow it down ) . When light encounters a medium outside of a vacuum ( like water or simply air ) , this new medium will cause the light radiation to be slow down . When light changes speeds in separate mediums it looks like the light is being bent . Hence , the visible distortion of whatever object is on the other side of this hot gas . A cool example of this distortion is having a pencil in a glass of water . When you compare the way the pencil looks outside of the water to the way it looks inside of the water you 'll notice that the two sides of the pencil will not coincide ( they wo n't make a straight object ) . This is because the water ( which is more dense than air ) is causing visible light to slow down and appear to be bent .","Because hotter air moves faster , the light bounces around more when it hits those molecules , and your eyes detect it as wavy distortion .

With the helicopter on the ground , and the collective neutral ( blades tilted so they are n't providing lift ) you can articulate the disc down to head chopping height pretty easily . This is why you never approach a ' turning ' helicopter without the pilot signalling , so they have positive control of the cyclic in a neutral ( level ) position .

There 's Polaris , as others have mentioned before , but even if you ca n't find Polaris , the rotation of the Earth can help you . Stars \" move \" to us below on Earth a lot faster than one probably expects ; give it a good five minutes and everything will have slightly shifted , easily telling you what 's heading where . If it 's rising , that 's East , sinking , that 's West . When it comes to sailing , they had tools and training to assist them with this . A sextant is a tool used to measure the altitude of a celestial object relative to the horizon , often the sun or Polaris , in order to figure out their latitude . There were huge charts plotted out with the brightest stars used for navigational purposes , so they 'd know where any celestial body would be at any time of year . They came prepared ! And also -- the stars are indeed moving slowly throughout space , as are we , but it takes thousands of years for the stars to have shifted enough to be inconsistent with old charts . The ancient Egyptians knew of a different pole star ( Thuban ) , but Polaris has been the northern pole star through all of modern history , and will still be reliable as such until about 4000 CE .","The movement of the stars has little to do with navigation on Earth . Their change in the sky takes thousands of years to notice . More important is the movement of the Earth . It spins in 24 hours so almost all stars rise and set as the sun does . All of them rise in the East and set in the West . For voyages they will rise at the same time , follow the same path , and set at the same time . They will rise and set at the same angle from the East West line . This does change with the seasons but not for voyages unless they take seasons to complete . In any case the movement with the seasons is regular and can be predicted . The few stars which do not rise and set include the polar stars , stars so close to the North and South pole that they are always visible at night , or invisible from the latitude being sailed . There are different circumpolar stars for each pole . The polynesians were best at Ocean navigation . They knew the latitudes of the major island groups and would sail to them based on the stars which rose along the East West line at that time of year . At each latitude certain stars will rise directly East depending on the season . They also used birds and reflected wave patterns to determine the direction towards the desired island .","You look for constellations , or groups of stars , and record their position relative to you .

The new consoles have completely different hardware that basically makes them incompatible with running previous generation games . Do n't think of this as xbone trying to run xbox360 , think of this as PC trying to running xbox360 and you 've got the same obstacles . A whole emulation software would need to be developed and implemented into the console , which would take up space , time , and money . The first PS2 was able to be backwards compatible because the literally shoved a PS1 into the console . Later they were able to develop an emulator program for it . The Xbox360 has emulation programs for classic xbox titles as well ( or the titles themselves were ported ( translated ) into a format the 360 could understand ) , and even then it was n't 100 % perfect . And the emulation program gets harder and more complicated because the games being used are complex . And what would all that money and time yield for either company ? Its not exactly a selling point , and if you want to use the older games , then you can buy the older consoles to do so . If anything , adding backwards compatibility will hurt sales of the older units ( as people will simply refrain from buying one and wait until the next gen console came to the market ) . TL;DR - backwards compatibility takes time and money that neither company seems interested in investing .","> Surely its just a matter of adding the code for running previous console games onto the new software ? Er ... sometimes . But it 's significantly more complicated than that . Why do n't mac games run on a PC ? Well .. because OSX is different than windows , so there are a huge collection of libraries you need to use . You need to write programs differently for each operating system . With the Xb2 and PS3 they used a different architecture hardware than the PS4 and XB3 ( which both use basically glorified AMD laptop parts ) . So not only do you have new OS problems but you have to deal with hardware differences too . Now in the PC programming space or mac or the like where a program I wrote for windows XP will still work on windows 8 that 's because you 've written the program , and it depends on libraries that force it to be general . Console games are tightly ( very tightly ) optimized for exactly the hardware they have . There 's no question of having maybe 32 bytes of memory here , or 16 , or 64 , on a console you definitely have exactly what you have , and it performs exactly the way it does . Sony actually botched one of their runs of PS2 's and they did n't quite work with every game for this reason . Windows ( and mac ) require you accept inefficiencies in your program - for example default directX and OpenGL , because for a small hit in performance they 'll work on all sorts of devices and new ones going forward . So are there solutions to this ? Yes ... kinda . Other than for just putting the old console inside the new one ( the original PS3 did essentially that , it had a hardware PS2 inside ) Both are varying degrees of bad . What you need to know is that when you write a program ( particularly a game ) you rely on a bunch of libraries that come with the operating system it 's going to run on , and you compile into assembly instructions specific to that OS and hardware - that 's what compilation is in general but not everything is compiled . Compilation makes things run fast though . The first option is what is called binary translation - basically you can take the program and map the binary level instructions from one type of hardware to a new type of hardware . This is how the XB2 tried to do compatibility with the XB1 - but it uh ... only mostly worked , some of the time . And that was from PC - which is the standard architecture around which all others are measured . The other option is emulation - you can download free emulators for your PC for old consoles , they are of dubious legality , but they mostly work . The think here is that making an emulator well is really really really hard , and can require many dozens to hundreds of times more processing power than the device you are emulating , and even then it can still suck . The new 3rd option is what sony is going to do - they 're going to have a giant cluster of Playstation 3 's to run games over the web ( like netflix for PS3 games ) . That has some issues with networking , but it 's probably ' good enough ' . They do n't solve problem 1 or 2 - they just basically let you rent time on a PS3 remotely . Or at least they plan to . So the long and the short of it , is that it 's REALLY hard to emulate another device - there are free ( legal ) android emulators for development that you can try and emulate all sorts of devices with - and a lot of them are slow as molasses and still suck . Binary translation is incredibly difficult to do properly . So the options are limited , and they 'd rather sell you a PS3 or a XB2 on the side than drive up the cost of the PS4 or XB3 .","It 's not just a matter of adding the code . It 's either adding essential parts of the previous generation 's chipset ( Original PS3 had this , ) or creating a program that emulates said chipset in a virtual environment ( which often ends up being buggy . ) And it 's a waste of their resources .

Just by saying that he is n't bad , we get the suggestion that he might at some point do something bad , even though he might not be in general a bad boy . In the end , the author 's choice of language has given us completely the opposite impression to the surface meaning of his words . Obviously this is a simple example . In fact , if a writer started a story with the line ' Tommy was not a bad boy ' he 'd probably want us to think that in the course of this story Tommy will do some very questionable things . But in a longer piece , picking out the opposite meanings of words can completely undermine what the writer wants to say . The point of deconstruction is to show that words are so full with meanings that it 's almost impossible to know that when I say ' fast ' and mean quick - moving , you could be thinking the complete opposite .

A Deconstruction would explore how a society would react to that ability . > Note that while deconstructions often end up darker , edgier , sadder and more cynical than the normal version , with the deconstructive process often playing a trope for drama and revealing the Fridge Horror inside it , there is no reason they have to . Deconstructions can exist anywhere on the Sliding Scale of Idealism Versus Cynicism . Expanding on the Dungeons & Dragons example above , a cynical deconstruction would involve either the clerics being enslaved for their powers or becoming the ruling class , while an idealistic deconstruction would involve the dissolution of war as scarcity disappeared . Either one is perfectly valid . > The reason fictive deconstructions often turn out as they do is that fiction by its definition virtually ignores anything that is n't specifically included , while hiding anything that is included but not spelled out . Thus , for instance , a work in which gender , or sexuality , poverty , race , or politics etc . should have been important but were never dealt with adequately is ripe for a deconstruction in which the fact that nobody talks about these topics indicates that something is amiss . Contrariwise , a work that attempts to pre - emptively avert being deconstructed in this way by stating , perhaps frequently , that certain topics are n't dealt with because they are specifically irrelevant to the story \/ setting ( especially if there 's no good reason they should be irrelevant ) , is ripe for an ironic deconstruction in which the supposed insignificance of these topics does n't stop characters from regurgitating contemporary Real Life attitudes about them . > Also note that Darker and Edgier , Rule of Drama and Cynicism Tropes do not turn works into Deconstructions . There are plenty of dark , edgy and dramatic tropes that are used without ever exploring the meaning behind them , or their realistic implications . While some of the most acclaimed works in their respective genres are deconstructions , and many deconstructions do utilize dark , cynical and dramatic tropes in the setting , it is the careful use and analysis of them that makes them acclaimed , not because they just have those tropes in them . See Not A Deconstruction . > Deconstruction is usually targeted at tropes that have become stale or less effective . The Deconstruction process , by putting tropes in Real Life , often reveals things we were n't thinking about for a reason , perhaps revealing a trope as false \/ unrealistic \/ horrifying , which is why it tends to be depressing . ( If a Deconstruction reveals a trope as beautiful truth it will probably be uplifting . ) Reconstruction is when the trope is then put back together , usually in a way that strengthens the trope . Think of it as Deconstruction taking apart your broken car engine , and Reconstruction puts it back together so it runs again . > Deconstruction and reconstruction can become Cyclic Tropes . A set of conventions is established ( the initial \" construction \" of the genre or ideas that are used in the story ) , this set of conventions is played straight until some author gets bored or frustrated with the implications the fantasy brings and decides to show us the unworkability of these conventions via a deconstruction of them . Atop the ruins , a more realistic narrative ( i.e. one that accepts the criticisms of the earlier deconstruction ) is then built via reconstruction , and in the future , this narrative gets deconstructed , etc . Cycles of deconstruction and reconstruction are basically how a genre or a trope evolves . from : [ TVTropes ] ( URL_0 )","Imagine a square . But not just any square : imagine a perfect square . In your mind , this square is completely , ideally perfect in every way . What if you 'd like to share your imaginary square with me ? You ca n't just put the thought in my mind ; you have to make a representation of it . You could draw it on paper , or make it from clay , or scratch it in the sand with a stick , or any number of things , in order to represent the square , so that I can understand it . However , in the process , the square has become an imperfect representation , for in each of the above examples the square must take on qualities which the imaginary perfect does not have : even drawn on paper , it takes on thickness ; made of clay , it has color ; drawn in the sand , it has dimensions . Of course , any way you try to represent it to me you must necessarily compromise your perfect ideal . The form of your conveyance will always be a failed model . Futhermore , because your conveyance is imperfect , I may perceive it to be completely and entirely different than your intention . For example , If your square is red , and you try to color it red , I may be red - green colorblind and unable to see that shade . Even if I can see your red , its tone may appear differently to me than you depending on the lighting in which we 've viewed it . Even if we look at it together , we 're necessarily seeing it from different angles . Deconstruction suggests that since any conveyance is imperfect , the purpose of art is nullified as inherently pointless . You may notice that this suggests it is ultimately futile for me to even attempt to convey this idea , as my understanding of it is ( in this model ) compromised by the necessity for me to choose appropriate words , in a language which we both understand . In fact , as Sabazius pointed out earlier , you may have perceived an entirely different message than I 've intended due to the nature of semantics . Taken to an extreme , this idea can be cynical and even nihilistic ; however , some consider that the pursuit of communication , even if inherently futile , is nonetheless a worthwhile endeavor .

You can think of stomach acid as regular old water that has tiny little lightning bolts floating around in it . These tiny lightning bolts go around blowing apart the food that you eat into tinier and tinier pieces . Your stomach is protected by a layer of snot so that it does n't get blown up . Eventually the food specks are so tiny that they can be absorbed right into your blood . The food slurry is then sucked into your intestine . The intestine has less snot to protect it , so your liver releases a special lightning - absorbing liquid that makes all the bolts strike out at once , producing a safe , nutritious slurry that 's ready for further breakdown and absorption . After all of the nutrients are absorbed , your intestine then absorbs all of the safe lightning - free water and recycles it . For the non - ELI5 : lightning = HCl , snot = mucus , food slurry = chyme , and lightning - absorbing liquid = bile","It is slightly absorbed by the mouth and esophagus ( throat ) through tiny holes , but the majority falls into your stomach . The stomach also has a small amount of these holes which also allows excess water to move , depending on the acidity level . The newly diluted acid then travels down to your intestine ( duodenum ) to become neutralized ( turned into salt + Water ) , and to be recycled back into the system . A large portion of water is then absorbed in the small and large intestines , where it enters our blood and liver .","It just mix in the stomach .

I do n't know exactly how it works or the details , but a group of people decide what changes to be added to the latest editions of the DSM every now and then . Should X be a disorder ? What category should it be under ( e.g. mood disorders ) ? How many of which symptoms does one need to have in order to be diagnosed ? How long must these symptoms have been present ? And so on . They look at the latest research ( and I 'm sure that of course , as with most things , somehow there are politics involved ) . Disorders are pretty much defined and diagnosed by symptoms in an effort to treat and study them . Homosexuality could be a psychological disorder , if the people who updated the DSM chose to define it as such ( though probably many people would disagree with it , but the DSM is what determines whether or not certain symptoms are a disorder ) . However , things are labeled as disorders so they can be treated , not because there is something in the brain that is different than the majority of people . If homosexuality were labeled a disorder , the implications would be that it would be treated . Though this used to be the case ( and homosexuality was indeed in the DSM ) , it is n't any more ( at least in western society as a whole today ) .

The director and technical director were at lunch at a diner that had a black menu with white letters . They came up with the idea of using a luminance key to overlay the names . They bought the menu and all of the letters off the diner for less than $ 100 and that 's how the first ' supers ' were done before computer graphics .

This means that we can have layers , like the crust , mantle , etc , that have different average masses . We ignore things like a giant hunk of lead sitting somewhere . In this case , gravity works out such that anything above you cancels out . So if you dig down into the earth 1 mile , the gravitational pull of all of the stuff above you exactly cancels with everything on the other side of the earth . This means that , as you get closer to the center of the earth , the net pull on you decreases with the decrease of mass . If we assume that the earth does n't have layers , we can look at the volume as 4\/3(pi)(r^3 ) . The force of gravity is directly proportional to the mass of an object , and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center . We can divide out the volume of the sphere to get a percentage of the mass at a certain distance compared to the full mass , with the distance factor thrown in : ( r_current^3 ) \/(r_current^2 r_total^3 ) .

Offense- As with most sports , baseball notwithstanding , the offense controls the ball with the main objective of scoring a touchdown . Downs- The offense has 4 \" downs \" or plays to advance the ball 10yds at which point they receive another 4 plays to work with . If a team fails to advance the ball 10 yds in downs 1 through 3 they typically \" punt \" or kick the ball down the field on 4th down at which point the other team receieves the ball and begins their offense from the furthest point the punt returner makes it to before being tackled . Scoring- a touchdown is scored when the player with the ball crosses the goal line . the player must be in compelte posession of the ball at the point of crossing . A touchdown counts for 6 points and is immediately followed by an \" extra point \" kick which brings the total to 7 . another option after scoring a \" TD \" is to go for 2 . which is when the offense lines up on the 2 yard line and attempts to cross the goal line again , at which point they are awarded 2 points for a successful conversion or 0 for a failure . a field goal is when the offense is too close to the endzone to punt but too far to to risk \" going for \" instead the team will choose to attempt and kick the ball through the uprights , the big yellow goal posts in the endzone , and for a succesful kick they are awarded 3 points after any scoring play there is a kick off which is similar to a punt in that it transfers possession and the opposing offense begins from where their furthurest forward motion with the ball is stopped . The offense consists of 11 players ; 1 quarter back - The \" general \" of the offense . The \" QB \" is the leader on the field and controls the offense , through marginal control of the play call and various adjustments of the formations . This gets into the more complexities of the game , but generally speaking the QB is the one who throws the ball and\/or hands the ball off to the running back . 1 - 2 running backs - the running backs typically stand behind the QB and can either recieve the ball from him , \" a handoff \" or act as an additional blocker for the Qb Offensive line - the offense line is made up of several players who s sole purpose is to prevent the QB from being tackled . the member of the \" O line \" at the center is surprisingly called the \" center \" his job , while still protecting the QB from being tackled , is to \" snap \" , give , the ball to the Qb . Receivers - There can be a number of recievers on the field . Typically the fastest are the \" wide receivers \" who generally are the ones running furthur down the field and do not do much blocking . THe other type of receiver is the \" tight end \" the tight end is usually bigger than a typical wide reciever and is used in a more short yardage situation and he s an imporatant job of blocking on many plays . Defense- Defensive line- the defense line is situated the exact opposite of the O Line and their main objective is to get to the QB and deliver pain . Line backers- the line backers are situated a few yards behind the D line and they , similar to the QB , are the generals of the defense . they have a very general objective to protect against the run , and the pass . They can also \" rush \" the qb and attempt to tackle , \" sack \" , him . defensive backs - these are typically the fastest players on the field and their job is to guard the wide receivers of the other team . they can either \" man up \" and defend a single player on a player or they can play a \" zone \" defense and cover an area of the field . Special teams- special teams are very important and can be overlooked at their impact of the game . Any time there is a kick off , punt , etc . the special teams are on the field . they can consist of members of the offense and defense but their main task to either stop the other team from returning a kick or to advance a kcik as far as you can . special teams are also on the field for field goals and extra points .

This signalling can be , as scrdest mentioned anything from a change in the environment ( nutrient availability , temperature , UV light , etc . ) to a message from another cell . There are different molecules in the cell sitting around and waiting to detect said stimuli and initiate an appropriate response cascade , culminating in the activation of the appropriate transcription factors . For example , oestrogen is made during pregnancy . It 's made as a response to the baby growing in the womb and releasing its own signals . The oestrogen then travels to the mother 's breast tissue , crosses the cell membranes in it and binds to the oestrogen receptors . This activates them and they initiate the transcription of proteins necessary for the proliferation of the cells . Another example is the IGF - mTOR - PI3 K signalling pathway - when there is enough glucose available ( particularly during growth ) the body produces IGF ( inslulin - like growth factor ) . IGF activates the IGF receptor , which activates mTOR . mTOR will tell the cell to stop digesting its own organelles for food and also trigger PI3 K , which will in turn activate transcription factors necessary for proliferation .","Nothing controls * all * of it at once . This is a massive interlocking system of various elements . There are some genes that are expressed all the time in any given cell . Those are typically those that are needed all the time , e.g. those that control the process of protein synthesis in general . The rest ... some are turned off by chemical modification of the DNA structure , either the DNA itself or the proteins it associates with , making the gene in that spot unavailable to the transcription mechanism . Some other gene might have a protein bound to it that blocks the transcription that is detached by interaction with something else , or conversely a protein that assists the transcription of that particular region may bind to the gene . Then there 's a special kind of RNA that can bind to the genes already transcribed and stop the transcribed gene from doing anything . They can be controlled by the many , many signalling pathways that respond to all kinds of things , from molecules to temperature , shear stress or what - have - you , which typically end in some molecule(s ) entering the nucleus and regulating the expression of the genes by one of the mechanisms above .","To add to the other comments , I wanna talk a bit about how things get turned on or off initially .

The alphabet used for modern English is very distantly descended from Egyptian hieroglyphs . Hieroglyphs represent a sort of midway point between a \" logographic \" writing system , where a symbol corresponds to a concept , and an \" alphabetic \" writing system , where a symbol corresponds more or less to a sound . Chinese is an example of a purely logographic system . The Phoenician alphabet developed from these hieroglyphs and entirely got rid of the \" character = concept \" idea . Instead , each Phoenician character corresponded to a single consonant sound - you were supposed to infer vowels from context . There were 22 of these letters , and they corresponded almost exactly to individual consonant sounds . But as the alphabet changed and evolved , things got messier . The Greeks borrowed the same letters , but also decided to include vowel sounds in written language . The Romans then borrowed from the Greek alphabet , and the Roman alphabet was further modified to write English . However , the correspondence between letters and sounds grew murkier with further levels of borrowing and adaptation . It 's basically just a historical coincidence we ended up with 26 letters . Some English sounds are written with two letters ( ex . ' sh ' ) , while some letters represent two sounds ( ex . ' x ' = ' ks ' , usually ) . Some sounds are written ambiguously ( ex . the ' th ' in ' thin ' and ' then ' are not pronounced the same ) . Some letters are seemingly redundant ( ex . ' c ' , which takes on the sound of either ' k ' or 's ' depending on context ) . Most dialects of English have 24 consonant sounds , so it would be entirely possible to come up with a new letter to write these . Old English actually used to have the letter ' \u00fe ' , which was equivalent to the modern ' th ' . This is besides the many different sounds that exist in other languages : the German ' ch ' has no equivalent in English , and is often pronounced like ' k ' by English speakers ( as in ' Bach ' ) . Vowels are even worse . Despite having only 5 letters for vowels , many dialects of English have as many as 14 vowel sounds ( consider just the distinctions between ' peat ' , ' pit ' , ' pet ' , ' pat ' , ' pert ' , ' putt ' , ' poo ' , ' put ' , ' paw ' , ' pot ' , ' pah ' , though not all dialects will distinguish all of these ) .

Let 's say we have a table where we want to store information about people . What do we want to keep track of ? How about first name , last name , height and eye color . These four things we want to keep track of become our column names . Now we add a row to the table for each person we want to keep track of .

The implied politics and economics usually follow as a consequence . The idealised theoretical definitions run something like this : \" Communism is the social system where * * all property is publically owned * * by the collective \" . ( And the government has the right to initiate physical force to achieve this end ) . \" Capitalism is the social system where * * all property is privately owned * * by individuals \" . ( And the government only has the right to use force in retaliation to those who initiate physical force ) . In the above theoretical framework , pure Communism and pure Capitalism sit at opposite ends of a spectrum - ( and Socialism describes various social systems that are some mixture of these two opposite principles regarding the preferred relationship between people and property ) . Communism has failed around the world , it can be argued , precisely because what it holds to be ideal \" as a concept \" is in fact completely antithetical with human nature - it is in contradiction with natural ethics . Trying to remove the causal * ownership * link between an individual his \/ her effects i.e. what he \/ she produces \/ earns tend 's to destroy an individual 's willingness to work .

People would borrow money from banks to buy houses and it was very safe because it was very rare that someone would not pay the bank back . It made a lot of money because they could charge a fairly low interest rate , but the loan would exist for upwards of 30 years . Then , someone came up with the idea of selling mortgages . So say you have $ 10 and I want to buy lunch . I borrow the $ 10 from you and promise that I will pay you $ 2 for every day that I do n't pay you back . So you know that I wo n't pay you back for two days , so you will make $ 4 from me . Instead of holding onto this loan , you tell Fred that I owe you $ 10 . So you tell Fred that if he gives you $ 12 , then you would sell him my debt . He then takes my debt and I owe HIM $ 14 after the end of the two days . So he makes $ 2 and you make $ 2 on the deal and I get lunch . Now you are making enough money doing this , so you do this a lot . You start lending out money to a lot of people , then bundling these debts together and selling them to other people . This is fine , because people are still paying off the debts so everyone is making money ( except the people paying , but they get a house ) . Because this is so profitable , you start lending out money to people who have no job or other source of income . People who have no chance to pay you back . You then sell that debt to Fred . You make your $ 2 , but I ca n't pay Fred , so Fred now loses $ 12 and I lose my \" lunch \" ( Ok , the analogy started to break down here ) . The banks loaned out money that people had no chance to repay , then went on Wall Street and started selling these mortgages for a lot of money claiming that they were \" safe \" bets . The people lost their houses , because they could n't pay their mortgages and the people who bought the mortgages lost their money , but the banks still made their money . As a footnote , the people who took out the mortgages should n't have taken the mortgages they could n't pay back and the people buying the mortgages from the banks should have done better research into what they were buying and the regulating bodies should have seen what was going on and raised red flags earlier . There is a lot of blame to go around , but the banks are the ones who did n't lose as much ( and were bailed out for what they did lose ) . That 's one of the reasons people are so mad at the banks specifically . Then there 's a lot of talk of inequality in pay and taxes . This is answered well by DerBafog 's response . Edit : I 'm an idiot and always say \" loose \" when I mean \" lose \"","[ I 'll show you with pictures ] ( URL_0 ) .","* There are two sources of income when banks issue a mortgage : the fees that homeowners initially pay when getting a mortgage , and the future payments that homeowners will make to repay the loan . Traditionally , the issuing bank makes money off of these future cash flows . * Some ( many ) banks start working only to get the fees , and then sell the future cash flows as an investment . These banks do n't care about the credit quality of the homeowners because they 're going to get the fees , and then sell the mortgage . These banks offer high interest mortgages to people with a high chance to default on their loan . As more houses get sold , fewer houses exist , so the price of houses increase . People involved : homeowners , local banks * Investment bankers ( Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac ) interested in maximum returns are the ones who buy these risky mortgages , which have startlingly high interest rates . Risk is bad , but just like how you can buy insurance for physical things , banks can buy insurance in case their investment fails . ( For example , I could borrow 100 dollars from you and offer to pay you back 110 , but you take the risk that I do n't pay you back at all ; alternatively , we could go to an insurer who will pay you back 105 whether I pay them or not ) . Assuming that the insurance company(AIG ) does n't go under , this investment is 100 % \" risk free \" , and gives interest at a considerably higher rate of return than the true risk free government bond yield . Groups involved at this point : Homeowners , local banks , investment banks , insurance companies * Now , we have these \" risk free \" high yield mortgage backed securities around , and everybody wants them . Investors want more , and insurance companies are happy to take in the fees , so investment banks ask the local banks for more mortgages , which lead the local banks to offer increasingly risky mortgages . All of this inflates both the price of houses , as well as the value of the market . Now we have involved in this big thing : homeowners , local banks , investment banks , insurance companies and investors * Here 's where it gets messy . People start defaulting . For the insurance company : If some people default , that 's a minor issue because the insurance company makes less money than they expected . If the majority of people start defaulting , the amount that the insurance company has to pay exceeds the value of the company as a whole . Whoops . This is bad , because in spite of this one investment being ( very ) bad , the insurance company insures people 's cars , houses , offers life insurance , etc . For the investment banker : A lot of banks invested heavily into these mortgage backed securities . Some investment banks actually borrowed money so they could invest even more into these securities ( called leverage ) , sometimes in excess of borrowing 50 dollars for every 1 dollar invested . Upon finding out that insurance companies could n't cover the defaults , the price of the investments plummeted , and investment banks suddenly did n't have the cash to stay open . This is bad , because these investment banks still had other rather large profitable clients like retirement funds , university trust funds , etc . For the homeowner : The price of houses had been steadily increasing . Suddenly , the value of their houses halved . For some people in the early part of their mortgage , the price of the house was less than the price on the mortgage . People who owned a larger stake in their houses lost a large amount of equity . For the local bank : Banks operate in the day to day using small loans between banks . Usually this money is nearly free flowing , at a very low interest rate , but because of the sudden freeze of liquidity at the investment banks , interest rates increased , and even the credibility of a solid bank was not enough to secure low interest rates . This greatly affects the everyday operations of a bank , which are essential to financing people 's large purchases . The government chose to help out some investment banks , and insurance companies , using the logic that insurance companies still provide a lot of value to anybody that needs insurance , and that investment banks are necessary to help invest in businesses and stimulate the economy .

Well , we insert the big head inside a cylinder , and we fill the cylinder with a spray of fuel . If we then make a spark in the cylinder , the fuel spray explodes and pushes the piston down . If you add a second piston like in the drawing , the explosion will not only push the first piston down , but also the second piston up . When the second piston is up , you make an explosion there . Boom ! The second piston goes down , and the first goes up again . And that way , you can make the axle turn round and round , which makes the wheels turn . So why is fuel necessary ?

It was expected that a good chef would be able to assess a recipe with its ingredients and determine exact - ish quantities of things . For example , if a recipe for chicken called for cinnamon then the chef knew they probably did n't need handfuls of it . Whereas if it was for something like a spiced bread more cinnamon would be needed . Or if bread needed to be baked the chef was supposed to know things like time and temperature ( they also did n't really have a good way to measure temperature until the mid 1700 's ) . This would also be modified by the tastes of the people you were cooking for as well as the availability of certain ingredients or the prevailing social \/ religious customs of the area as it related to food .

In answer to your second question : There are four main forces at work on an airplane : lift , thrust , drag , and gravity . Lift is a result of air being forced over the wings , and like I said , the explanation of why airplanes fly explains the first part pretty well . Lift usually counteracts gravity and vice versa . So we 're just going to talk about thrust and drag . In order for a plane to fly it has to have air moving over its wings . This means that you have to have something pushing the plane , usually a propeller or a jet engine . Once the plane starts moving air starts hitting the plane and pushing back against it . This is called drag . At lower altitudes the air is thicker so drag is higher . Climbing to a higher altitude means the engines do n't have to work nearly as hard because there 's less air pushing back against the plane . As a result , planes can fly faster and farther than they can at lower levels . In addition , pilots will also climb to higher altitudes so they can fly over storms or other weather that might make it harder to fly .","[ Searched ] ( URL_0 ) Relevant [ discussion ] ( URL_3 ) Original text by [ borntoperform ] ( URL_2 ) > Explain like I 'm actually a five year old playing around with a model airplane , and I ask you how , \" How do planes weigh so much but are able to fly in the sky ? \" Relevant comment courtesy [ Yondee ] ( URL_1 ) > Alrighty little Jimmy ! Let 's take a look at this model airplane you have . It is pretty neat right ? There are some specific pieces of the plane that are very important to it staying in the air . The first , obviously are the wings , but in order to understand the wings we need to make sure you understand the propeller . > Boy it is hot out ! Thank goodness we have that nice ceiling fan going . Do you notice how the ceiling fan is pushing air around Johnny ? Because the blades are angled it pushes the air down as the fan moves around in a circle right ? So we can picture the fan working like this : > * As the fan spins air is caught by the edge of the fan , the air is forced under the blade . > * Since the fan is still spinning and \" gathering \" more air on the top edge this new air pushes the air that was caught first down . > * This continues and the air flows down the edge of the blade until the edges stops . > * The air does n't stop there though . There no more pushing due to the fan blade , but the other air that is still being pushed by the fan blade pushes the air further downward . > * Now there is a nice breeze of cool air that reaches us as we look at this model plane , pretty neat huh Jack ? > Propellers are just fans that are sideways . They spin and push the air that is in front of them behind them . Propellers push much more air than our ceiling fan though . Since they push so much air in one direction they end up moving the plane in the opposite direction , that 's how planes move forward . You still with me Billy ? > Now that you understand how the propeller works we can talk about the wings . As you can see , the wings are shaped very similar to the blades on our fan and on the propeller . Let 's pretend our propeller is already running and we are on a very long runway . We start moving very fast . Our wings start working exactly like the fan blades pushing the air downward as we move forward . Now , exactly as the propeller forced air behind it to go forward , the wings are forcing air down to move up . WAKE UP BERNARD , I'M STILL TALKING ! ! > That is how a plane works . The smarty - pants who designed them figured out how to move the air backwards and downwards in order to make the plane go forward and up . Okay Sebastian , I hope you learned a lot . Now go outside and play with your plane , your mother and I have some \" work \" to do .","Planes fly by using \" lift . \" Lift is created by a nifty little shape called an airfoil . If you look at an airfoil in a cross - section view , it looks like a horizontal teardrop , but the top is curved more than the bottom ( sometimes the bottom is flat and only the top is curved . ) The principle at work here is that , as this shape moves through the air , the air is split ( think of air as a liquid ) and moves across the top and bottom of the airfoil . However , since the top of the airfoil is curved more than the bottom , the air that travels over the top of the airfoil has farther to travel ( like walking in a straight line as opposed to walking in a curve to get to the same destination ) . Since it has farther to travel , it has to go faster ( like walking in a straight line as opposed to walking in a curve to get to the same destination at the same exact time ) . Since air goes faster over the top of the airfoil , a sort of vacuum is created underneath the airfoil , where the slower - moving air is . This is lift ; it pushes the airfoil shape up from below . So , an airplane 's wing is just a big airfoil , creating the lift needed to counteract the drag ( friction and stuff of an object moving through the air ) of the airplane and take flight ! All planes follow these principles , but there are many different kinds of propulsion that planes use to get moving fast enough to make the airfoil work ( propellers , jet engines , turbojets , rockets ) . The engine does n't make a plane fly though , it just makes the plane move fast enough for the airfoil to create enough lift for the plane to fly . As for why planes fly high , there are many reasons . First , the air is thinner up high , so airplanes are more efficient ( less drag , lift has a greater effect , uses less fuel , travel faster ) . Also , they can fly above most weather , which means no storms or unpredictable wind to deal with . The jet stream and other global wind currents high in the sky also make it worthwhile to catch a ride ( just like the current in Finding Nemo ! ) ."],"2540":["Well it is actually used in some lesser played card games , and it 's sometimes used in variants of some more common games as a wildcard meaning it can represent any card you like .

Like you 're five : electricity causes magnetic fields , magnetic fields cause electricity . When the magnet is near the screen , it changes the electric characteristics of the electronics and the LCD behind the glass , so they distort randomly .

What generally apparently happens is that by the time this process has taken place , the media no longer cares and has moved on to some other story .","If you 're referring to the the paid leave that you hear about police being put on their is a reddit post that sums it up pretty well that is only the first part of the punishment process .

Basically , there 's no definitive answer yet but there a couple popular hypotheses for why homosexuality has persisted in males : * * * Female Fecundity Hypothesis * * - states that certain genes , when possessed by males , predispose them towards a homosexual orientation . However , these genes are not eliminated from the gene pool because they drastically increase the reproductive fitness when inherited by a female . ELI5 version - So given certain gene , if male = gay ; if female = lots'o baby making * * * The Balanced Polymorphism Hypothesis * * Argues that genes that express feminine physical characteristics and personality traits increase reproductive fitness in heterosexuals , but that an overexpression of these genes causes homosexuality . ELI5 version - being a little bit feminine can increase your chances of getting lucky with the opposite gender , but too much feminine and you become too fabuloussss for that sorta stuff * * * Alliance Formation Hypothesis * * - My personal favourite . States that in the past , males used sexual contact with other males as a way to form \/ strengthen relationships with them . Note that in many past societies , such as ancient Greece , it was not uncommon for a man to engage in homosexual behaviour with younger males while being married to a woman . Also note that it is only within the past couple centuries that the division of sexuality into heterosexual and homosexual identities has occurred . ELI5 version - Apparently our ancestors did n't need to scream \" NO HOMO \" when they touched their friend 's junk .","Evolution does n't really work like that . There are plenty of genes that persist that do not benefit the survival of the human race . There are millions of variations of the human genome and if it were that simple , everyone would have 20\/20 vision , be fantastic athletes , and have full heads of hair . But homosexuality does n't even really fit this example . There is not a simple answer to homosexuality , but scientists do agree that various environmental and biological factors contribute to its existence and that it is normal variation of sexual preference . There is no \" gay gene \" . Its not something you can pin point on a DNA strand . Do n't think of homosexuality as a genetic flaw . Try to think of it more as just one factor that makes people different from one another . I know this is not the answer as to why homosexuality exists .

Most computers , and in particular laptop \/ notebook computers , develop a tremendous amount of heat . Built - in security will back off the energy usage and processor speed to keep the heat down . And , quite simply , the innards of your computer are less efficient when they are hot . Unplug your laptop and take out the battery . Flip your laptop over and start taking out screws .

Picture a large field with a healthy population of bunnies - some are black , and some are white . In the winter , hungry hawks visit the field and eat the bunnies they find . Since it 's snowy in the winter , they find the black bunnies first . Many years later , only white bunnies live in the field , because their coloration gave them an advantage . * * Mutations * * . Sometimes , animals are born weird . It does n't happen often , but sometimes a critter just does n't get put together the way they expect . If you give it enough time , thousands of generations , you 're going to come across some interesting changes - longer limbs , thicker fur , better night vision . You 're also going to see a lot of unsuccessful mutations , but they die out and the successful ones survive . So , take these two ideas - that populations can change over time due to pressure from the environment , and that individuals are sometimes born with unusual ( and potentially useful ) new traits . Add 10,000 generations , and you 're going to see very different animals than you started with . The reason that Darwin figured this out is that on the Galapagos Islands , he was able to observe species that were clearly related to animals he knew from the mainland that had adapted to the environment and become new species . For instance , a bird that lived on field mice had adapted to dive for fish . That 's the Theory of Evolution .","Kids are basically copies of their parents , but during copying process , some genes get skipped , some get duplicated - there is a whole lot of errors , or \" mutations \" . They usually do n't change anything , some change a thing slightly and very , very rare ones change a lot . So basically , you get parents and kids that are slightly different than them ( slightly longer legs , slightly finer hair , bigger heart ect ) . When those kids have kids on their own , new kids are again slightly different than their parents , but it 's double the sightliness to their grandparents . Repeat the process a million times and you get kids that are million times slightly different than their grand^1,000,000,000 parents . That 's quite different . ---- That 's just a random chance though and evolution is guided through natural selection ( predators , disease , scarcity of food , environment , temperature ect ) . Let 's say you have rabbits living in some snowy country . Every kid rabbit with slightly whiter fur will have lower chance of dying to hawks . Out of 20 siblings , 8 had whiter fur , 10 had the same as their parents and 2 had grey fur ( random mutations ) . Now hawks hunt and eat the ones that stick out the most , leaving 18 rabbits . Again , hawks are hungry and hunt , again killing 2 that are the most likely to spot , and again and again . You are left with 2 slightly whiter rabbits that survived to be mature enough to have kids on their own , those parents are having 20 baby rabbits - some have fur of grandparents , some have fur of parents , some are slightly whiter . Repeat the process and again , only the rabbits with beneficial mutations will survive , passing those mutations onto the next generation . Eventually you get rabbits with totally different fur than their \" warmer \" cousins . As long as mutations allow you to have kids , they will prevail . Also , many characteristics change simultaneously , it 's not only colour , but also thickness , length , strength of teeth , muscle mass ect . ---- The most important thing about evolution that gets confused is that it * does not * explain how life began , only how we have so many different animals that seem to be similar to each other . If you still are confused , check out this simulation : [ link . ] ( URL_0 ) It replaces DNA with computer code for colour , but the principle is the same .","Lets say I 'm a giraffe , exactly 18 ft tall . I get myself a giraffe wife , also exactly 18 ft tall . we have , say , 5 little giraffe babies , who all grow up to be adult giraffes , whose heights are 17 ft , 17.5 ft , 18 ft , 18.5 ft and 19 ft . I can have children who are a foot taller or a foot shorter , because of random mutations that happen when you have kids . Now , the leaves we giraffes eat all grow 18 ft above the ground . me and my wife , we could eat them just fine . My two shortest children , though , ca n't reach the leaves . They , sadly , eventually die of starvation . The three remaining giraffes , however , all go on to have their own kids , who s heights range from 17 ft ( shortest child of the 18 ft one ) all the way to 20 ft ( tallest child of the 19 ft one ) . All the giraffes shorter then 18 ft die again , because they ca n't reach the leaves that they eat . But what about the 20 ft one ? well , he 's tall , but he 's much taller then he needs to be . He can reach the leaves , but his neck is very delicate and could break easily . He lives long enough to have 2 children , rather then the 5 that all the other giraffes have , before he tragically trips and breaks his neck . His kids are 19.5 and 20.5 ft tall . So this continues for a while , and eventually we get a sizable population of giraffes , none shorter then 18 ft , and a small minority that are 20 ft tall . Now , the trees that they eat the leaves off of ? * they are going through the exact same process * though somewhat slower . Short trees get eaten faster by all the giraffes , but tall trees live longer and can reproduce more . One day , the very last 18 ft tall tree dies . all that s left are the 20 ft tall trees . So what do the 18 ft and 19 ft tall giraffes do ? sadly , they start to die out . But the 20 ft tall minority ? they can still reach the leaves to eat ! so while their shorter cousins die out , they can keep eating and have children . they 're still delicate , but without the competition from the shorter giraffes , they can have about 4 children each . Now , the 18 ft tall giraffes are somewhat desperate . they really want to have their own kids . But they ca n't reach their food . By chance , however , one of the giraffes discovers that he 's slightly different from the others . He received a very rare mutation . The grass on the ground , that is poisonous to other giraffes , he can eat no problem . The others die out , but he can still eat the grass on the ground , and eventually has kids of his own , all of whom have the same mutation . The only thing is , suddenly being tall is a disadvantage , rather then an advantage . So , for his kids ( and his kids alone ) being much shorter is an advantage and being taller is a disadvantage . So his shorter descendants have more kids , and his taller descendants do n't . Eventually , ( after thousands of years ) his descendants are all 5 ft tall . The 20 ft tall giraffes are still there , but a new species * branched off * to form a new species . This is , in an extremely simplified form , how species develop over time , except there are hundreds or maybe thousands of different things that factor into how many children an individual has . Continue this process for millions of years , though , and you can get thousands of different species . Note that , despite what christians say , this theory makes * * no claims whatsoever as to how life started * * . it only describes how life changes over time ."],"3687":["Because the baby boomers wo n't accept responsibility .","I think all generations have had to deal with that to some extent , but now it 's their turn . \" You kids are so [ negative trait here ] !

When Generation X grew up , the Baby Boomers , who made up the Woodstock generation , began to fear losing the limelight to a new group of people who were young , setting new trends , and moving popular culture in a different direction . So naturally , the Boomers sought to dismiss the up - and - comers by labeling them with an X , figuratively crossing them out . As Generation X began to have children , the Boomers who by now were middle - age , gleefully noticed that their children could also be labeled with a letter , the one following X in the alphabet . And so they were called Generation Y , as in \" Why ? \" , or \" What 's the point ? \" It was doubly satisfying to the Boomers because they could also say they held them in so little regard that they could n't be bothered coming up with any more original name than to use the letter following X. As Generation Z approaches , however , trouble lurks over the horizon . If you adopt the same convention of using letters , then after Generation Z you 'd either run out , or you 'd have to wrap - around and call them Generation A. This is intolerable , because the letter A has positive connotations to it . For example , it represents the highest grade you can get in school .

That , coupled with a means of breathing oxygen , is a valid theoretical space suit concept for a place like Mars . In fact , there have been prototypes built , as far back as 50 years ago . However , a couple things . -No one so far has been able to design a mechanical counter pressure suit that provides adequate and consistent pressure across the entire body - especially in areas of mobility , in concave areas like the groin or armpit , etc . There have been multiple attempts to do better , but the capability is not quite there , is likely decades off , requiring advancements in material technology that do not yet exist . -You still need thermal protection . On Mars you 'd have some fancy flexible aerogel foam or something . Most of these notional sci - fi suits in movies are not really showing that . -You would probably still have a pressurized helmet , because that would be much more comfortable than breathing out of a mask while having a skin - tight garment across your face . So then you need to seal that helmet around your neck .

All this said - when material advancements occur that facilitate solving all these problems , mechanical counter pressure provides some amazing theoretical advantages over gas - pressurized suits .

Generally , the amount of storage in any power grid is going to be very small and fluctuations of power demand are managed mostly by changing the amount of electricty being produced or through special agreements with large electricity users which allow grid managers to cut their supplies on short notice . Some places do have grid - scale energy storage in the form of pumping water from one reservoir to another , higher reservoir and then releasing it through hydro - electric turbines back the other way . There are also early installations which use compressed air in underground caverns to store electricity . The use of chemical capacitors ( like batteries ) is extremely limited in managing electrical load .","Power plants do n't but on the town level they have things called substations that have capacitor banks that deal with the high frequency spikes . Generally , power requirements are predictable on an hourly granularity , so these substation capacitor banks are more than enough to cope with the minute by minute \/ second by second demand changes . In addition , large industrial complexes often have their own supplies from power stations and their own substations and they are generally very predictable .

There are some grid storage scale batteries that are used around some of the large cities , but those are more for maintaining frequency for very short time intervals . Frequency is actually more tightly controlled than voltage because it has a lot more effect on grid stability . If the frequency gets too out of whack , all the various generators across a large geographic area can lose synchronicity and start shutting down . The main issues is the sheer amount of power you 're talking about . Your average home has electrical service up to about 10KW . At peak , a car battery can produce about 1KW ( not for long ) . A large power plant will produce 1 - 2 GW . The energy loss to store the energy in the batteries , then take it back out , plus all the overhead to maintain the batteries and replace them make them unfeasible for large energy . At the power plant level , different plants can respond to changing demands at different speeds . Nuclear and Coal plants are slow . They are used for ' base load ' . Just to start one of these up can take multiple days . Changing their power output can take hours . Basically , you start these up , set them to a level , and mostly leave it there . The variation over the course of the day and minute by minute is most often handled by natural gas plants . These plants can change power level in minutes . \" Peaker \" plants are even faster . They are made of small , very quick natural gas turbines than can respond in tens of seconds . Hydroelectric is a bit unique . It 's primarily intended more as base load , but it can change power levels much faster just by closing the water hatches . They are actually very efficient plants , but are obviously limited to being built where terrain and water are suitable . As far as wind \/ solar , these will sometimes have batteries \/ capacitor to smooth out their power being put onto the grid . But since they effectively have no fuel cost , the cost of the batteries can be justified . Also , with wind plants , the blades can also be trimmed to catch less of the wind to maintain smooth generation ( or to protect the turbine from damage in too strong of wind ) .

There 's years ' worth of study in this field , which is known as quantum mechanics , but it 's important to understand one major part known as the Standard Model . The Standard Model is essentially a Periodic Table of Elements for all of the different types of particles . Some particles make up matter ( like atoms ) , others act as messengers and transmit forces ( think magnetic forces ) , but what 's important is that the Standard Model is supposed to explain why matter and forces act the way we do . The good news : the Standard Model does this , and it does it * insanely well * . It makes prediction after prediction and continues to match up with experiment . However , there 's an important part missing : what gives things mass ? Despite a century of understand into what makes stuff stick together or explode or attract , we do n't know why anything has mass . Physicists are really smart , though , and in the 1960s a bunch of them figured out this complicated idea involving a new particle which would ordain other particles with mass . The particle was named the Higgs boson , after one of those physicists , Peter Higgs . Once the theorists conjecture the existence of a new particle , such as the Higgs boson , it becomes the job of the experimentalists to find it . The problem , however , is that the experimentalists can not observe the Higgs directly : they must look for its tracks . This is pretty analogous to trying to find a deer in the woods by looking in freshly fallen snow for deer prints . Now imagine there 's also been a stampede which escaped from the local zoo and you have to still find that one deer 's prints among the stamped snow left from the stampede . As you can imagine , that takes a while . To find the Higgs , it also means it takes an entirely new , more powerful instrument to try to find it : the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) at CERN , a research facility in Europe . The amount of time , money and effort being poured into finding this one particle has led to perennial news coverage , where the Higgs boson was eventually nicknamed \" the God Particle . \" You 've actually asked this question at an exciting time : on Tuesday , 12\/13 , the researchers at CERN are going to release a major batch of data and analysis from the LHC , which should contain information on whether the Higgs boson actually exists . If they find it , it will be a major vindication of decades of work and the completion of a major unanswered part of the Standard Model .

Portugal , Spain , the Netherlands , and England were exploring the New World and India and Southeast Asia , but Russia turned eastward ( at this time , it consisted only of the European part ) . And so it sent explorers and adventurers into Siberia and the Russian Far East and then they sent out colonizers and started towns and cities and assimilated the natives and Russia 's territory grew . ( Interestingly , Russian explorers crossed the Bering Sea and operated in Alaska a lot , even getting as far down as the American continental Northwest .

The answer is different for every nation . Spain 's golden age was short and soon after the American Revolution , Latin America realized it could rise up and declare independence - and so it did . The rest of its empire was lost in a war with the United States , and probably would have declared independence soon afterward anyways .

DNA Microarray techniques are an extension and eventually replacement for doing this , as it potentially identifies the exact mutation(s ) that causes the normal cell to become a ( potentially dangerous ) tumor . Knowing what 's happening on a genetic basis gives the opportunity to better predict a prognosis , and give a more accurate ( hence more meaningful and possibly effective ) therapy . Edit : spelling .","So this is in the context of cancer research and by a non - PhD ( so I basically understand this LI5 ): If we take a chunk of tissue from a person or animal , we can put that tissue on a DNA Microarray and run it through a very large , very expensive machine and it will tell us what genes are present in that tissue - and in what quantities . The latter is something known as \" expression \" . Cancer is a disease where part of your body has decided to mutate in some way . Instead of growing and acting normally , the cells in your body have decided to grow unrestrained and start to take over the normal , healthy cells . Cancer is not like a cold or polio where there is a single virus or bacteria that caused it . It 's caused by your body mutating itself . So the big question is - why ? Why did the cells in your body decide to start mutating ? That 's what we use microarrays to help figure out . By putting a tumor sample on a microarray , we measure what genes are present in the tumor and in what quantities . The hope is that we can compare there results of the tumor measurement to that from a sample of normal tissue and determine which genes are possibly contributing to the mutation . For example , we might see that in a lung cancer patient that gene XXXX should have a level of 2 , but in their tumor has a level of 10 . What this means is that the DNA in the cells in the tumor are expressing too much of gene XXXX . Our next step is to then suppress gene XXXX , typically by finding a drug that is designed to do so . In fact , this can be a drug designed for any purpose at all - as long as it suppresses gene XXXX , we think it can treat this cancer . This idea of picking a drug to target a gene that we identify as \" out of spec \" is the core of what we call \" personalized medicine \" and is , IMO , a large part of the future of cancer treatment and healthcare is general . So what , exactly , is a microarray ? Well , the ones I 've seen in person are about the size of an ID badge . In the middle is the array , which is an N x M grid of little divots , each containing what we call a \" probe \" . It 's not a probe in the \" anal \" sense of extra - terrestrials , but really just a tiny bit of organic molecules . Each divot contains molecules that react with specific genes in a predictable way - older microarry probes actually changed color . So you put a tissue sample on the array , each probe reacts to the genes ( RNA actually ) in the tissue , and a computer reads the resulting color of the probe - much like you would look at the color of litmus paper to tell if something is an acid or a base .","Let me try and see if i can eli5 this :P So you know certain genes are responsible for a disease , you sequence them and then create probes for them . These are just the opposite sequence ( so if u have a ATTGCC gene sequence , the probe would have a TAACGG ) . When a sequence matches the opposite of probe , they will have the tendency to hybridize ( AKA bind together ) . The microarray chip is composed of little wells , where each of the well contains a different probe for different genes . This allows for testing for lots of genes with each essay . So now you take your sample RNA ( so you know if the DNA is being read by the cell ) , make a bunch of copies into DNA and mark them with a dye . You slap those in the micro array chip and see which well have the dye present . Since you know which gene corresponds to which well you now know which genes are being expressed . There 's some variations of this , but this is the basis of microarrays . Btw there 's a new fad , the next generation sequencing techniques that might take over microarrays as soon as they 're cheaper and more accurate . You might wanna check those out .

It 's a bit like asking how do animals work . There are a great number of different types of animals that may or may not have some similarities and in some regards are vastly different . Similarly there is n't just one technique for AI , there are a huge number of different approaches . Each have different strengths and drawbacks depending on where you intend to use it . And ultimately you will almost always have to create a unique AI for your specific needs . Different methods may serve as starting points but they are n't ready - made solutions that you can just plug - in . Let 's use the board game Monopoly as an example . First rolling the dice . If you do n't want your AI to cheat then there 's nothing to do about that . But a little cheating can be a very effective way of creating an illusion of a better player and an easy way to compensate for the difficulties of making an actual smart AI . Traditionally AIs in computers games have definitely cheated on numerous occasions . Then the AI lands on some property that 's available for buying . Now try to think how you make a decision of whether you want to buy it or not . What kind of things affect your decision ? Probably something like how much cash you have , what other properties of the same colour are still available or owned by you , how many other properties you already own , do you have full ownership of some other colours , how close towards the end of the board the property is , are other players likely to land on this property soon , and so on . You might consider all these things but will ultimately make a decision mostly based on gut feeling . A computer needs something more specific . One way is to somehow give a score , say between 0 and 10 , indicating how desirable the property is from a specific point of view . Then if the total score is above some value the AI buys it , otherwise it does n't . Now we 've broken down the decision making into a series of smaller questions that still need answering . For example , let 's just consider the question \" how many other full sets do I have \" . We could say that it 's desirable to have three full sets . If we have none then this question gets a score of 10 , if we have one it gets 7 , if we have two it gets 3 and otherwise 0 . That 's one very simple way of scoring that . We could come up with similar simple rules to score all aspects of the decision making . This is just one very crude way of approaching the problem . There are a lot of different ones too . You could calculate probabilities of certain things happening and see how buying the property changes those probabilities . You could do random simulation games from the current point and see what happens in the case you buy it or do n't buy it . Then there are a bunch of self - learning methods where it 's hard to say how exactly the AI ended up making the decision it did , it just had learned to do that . For example , the probability method might not be so good in Monopoly but might be great in some card game . Or you could make an AI using a combination of using all these .","What Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) typically refers to is by now an outdaded almost overly simplistic concept : The behavior of an AI based on mindlessly following a set of pre - defined fixed rules that prescribe differen behaviors for different situations .

When your computer starts up , it wants to connect to a computer network , usually the Internet but sometimes a corporate network . The reason it wants to connect is so that you can check your mailbox and surf the web . In order to be able to connect to a network , your computer needs a unique address assigned to it . Compare this to sending a Valentine card through the postal system to your sweetheart . The postal system requires you to write the address of your sweetheart on the envelope . In much the same way , every computer that wants to use a computer network needs an address . For the postal system , an address is a street name , house number , city , state and zip code . For a computer network , an address is a number , called the IP address ( IP is short for Internet Protocol ) . Now , back to your question . When your computer starts up and connects to the network , it needs an IP address . There are several ways of getting one . The most simple one is that your computer already knows what its IP address is ( stored somewhere in a local configuration file ) and it simply uses that . This is called a static IP address and is mostly used for small networks , for instance a home network . Another way of getting an IP address is to ask the network you are connecting to for an address . This is where DHCP is used . What happens here is that on startup , your computer essentially sends a \" Hello ! What is my IP address ? \" question to all the computers on the network . However , it does not speak English but DHCP gibberish instead . Most of the other computers on the network are not able to understand DHCP gibberish and will simply ignore the question . However , one or maybe two computers on the network * * do * * speak DHCP gibberish and are able to answer your question : \" Your IP address is 192.168.1.101 \" ( this is the way IP addresses are written down ) . Your computer understands this answer and will adopt this IP address for as long as you stay connected to the network . If you switch off the computer , it will not be able to remember what its address was the next time you power it up and the whole Q : \" Hello ! What is my IP address \" A : \" Your address is 198.172.1.99 \" will be repeated . Notice that the second time , you receive a slightly different address ( ending in 99 instead of 101 ) . This is due to the \" dynamic \" part of DHCP . When you shut down your computer , the address that it had ( 192.168.1.101 ) is no longer occupied by your computer . So if someone else comes along and asks for an address , the DHCP computer may decide to recycle your old and now free IP address . Since an IP address must be unique , when your computer starts up again and requests an IP address , the old address will be already given to another computer so you receive another address in response . Now , for DNS . On the Internet , each and every computer must have a unique IP address . This IP address is a number . People in general are not very adept at recalling numbers . For instance , the IP address of the Google computer is 173.194.65.105 . I had to look it up . But URL_0 is something that I can recall from memory . What DNS does , is it translates human - readable website names to computer - readable IP addresses . So when you are in your web browser and decide to go to Google , what happens is that your computer poses a question to a special other computer . The question is \" Hey , can you tell me the IP address for URL_0 ? \" The special other computer looks up the name URL_0 and returns the IP address for that name . The \" special computer \" part in this case is a DNS server . It exists to translate names into numbers . When you connect to the Internet through your provider , your provider tells your computer what the IP address is for the special other computer that provides this name - to - IP - address translation service . So every time your computers needs to translate a website name to an IP address , it uses the IP address for the DNS server to pose the question . That is what DNS does","Imagine your computer network is an office with lots of cubicles separated by low walls . Now , there are no \" fixed \" cubicles assigned to individual employees : Everyone comes to work with their things in a briefcase and has to find an empty one to use for the day .

In towns without a law enforcement officer , people took the law into their own hands , generally with the help of a gun ."],"2183":["There are two designs of nuclear bombs , gun and implosion . Gun design bombs are actually very simple , its basically two lumps of uranium which are fired into each other using a gun - like mechanism . Nuclear explosions happen when you reach what is called \" critical mass \" . Basically that means there 's enough uranium packed into a small enough space that it can react with itself , causing a chain reaction and explosion . The gun design has half - sphere lumps which are approximately half - critical mass , then it fires them together so that it makes one critical mass lump . The second type are more complicated , basically you have a sphere of uranium which has explosives all around it . The explosives have to be very carefully designed in order in compress the sphere equally all around as they explode . These are called shaped charges and were one of the difficulties in making bombs work well . The implosion design is more potent when it goes off correctly , so all modern bombs are designed liked that . But as you can imagine making hundreds of explosions all go off perfectly in sync is really difficult . This design works by compressing the single lump of uranium that is too big spread out to be critical mass , into a smaller more compressed lump that is critical mass . But obviously it has to be compressed in the correct way otherwise things go wrong . But this ignores the main difficulty which is actually getting the uranium . Most normal uranium out of the ground is U238 , 99.3 % in fact . However to make a bomb you need uranium that 's mostly made out of U235 ( around 0.7 % in the ground , and you need to make it around 80 % usually to be weapons grade ) . Filtering out the 238 to leave only 235 is called enrichment and is a complicated thing . The first technique that was used in the Manhattan project was called \" electromagnetic separation \" . In this you take natural uranium and vaporise it , then you ionise it ( which means basically give it an electromagnetic charge ) . Then you pass that ionised uranium vapour through a magnetic field and the magnetic field bends the path of the U235 slightly more than it does the U238 . You can use that to capture the U235 in its separate path . The machines to do this were called \" Calutrons \" , most of the U235 that went into the Hiroshima bomb was made with this technique , but even with dozens of these massive machines running it still took several years to make enough uranium for one bomb . They were not very efficient . A more modern uranium enrichment process is called Gaseous diffusion , in this you make the gas compound uranium hexafluoride by mixing natural uranium with fluoride . And force it through a semi - permeable membrane made of Telfon , when you do this the lighter U235 moves faster through the membrane than the heavier U238 , so you can separate it out that way . The real difficulty of this method is finding a material that 's semi - permeable , but is n't corroded by the very corrosive uranium hexafluoride . Another modern technique are gas centrifuges . Basically you use the same uranium hexafluoride , but spin it very very fast in tubes , The heavier U238 goes to the outer parts of the tube so you can filter that off . However you have to spin these things super fast like 90 - 100,000 rpm . So the main difficulty here is making a tube that can withstand such massive speeds without tearing itself apart . Proper centrifuges are made out of maraging steel , which is this super high strength steel , and those can go the crazy speeds I mentioned above . Gas centrifuges are the most common technique nowadays , and you 'll often read articles about Iran , etc having centrifuges . Its very hard to make such perfect tubes so massively strong without maraging steel , and maraging steel is heavily monitored for international trade , so Iran has had to use aluminium tubes . These aluminium tubes are not nearly as good , so you can ca n't spin them as fast , which means they 're much less efficient . So much so that even with the hundreds of centrifuges Iran has it 'll take them a year or two to make enough U235 for one bomb rather than weeks \/ months with more high tech ones . I 've also neglected to mention plutonium here , so briefly : There 's a second material you can use to make bombs , plutonium , specifically Pu239 . Now plutonium does n't really exist in nature , so you have to make it . And you make it inside nuclear reactors . By exposing U238 to neutron radiation inside a nuclear reactor you can turn it into Plutonium . However like Uranium there are two main kinds , Pu239 , which is the stuff you want for bombs , and Pu240 which contaminates the Pu239 and causes bombs made out of it to \" fizzle \" if there 's too much 240 . So in order to keep the levels of Pu240 low you have to expose your uranium to the radiation only for relatively short periods of time . For this you basically need to design a nuclear reactor that allows you to frequently take out the old fuel and put new fuel in without having to shut down the whole reactor . It 's for this reason that certain countries civilian nuclear power programmes are looked upon with suspicion . Certain designs allow this kind of rapid refuelling whilst other ones do n't . Anyway the second bomb that hit Nagasaki was made using plutonium . * * Edit * * : Added a lot more information . * * Edit * * : Also , [ check out this lecture ] ( URL_0 ) its wonderful and goes into all this information in language most people can understand .","Imagine you have a box of 1,000 BBs , all identical , except that 7 of them are 1 % lighter than the rest .

So straight away you 've got a problem -- finding a suitable whale ! Infrared cameras would be of no use in the ocean . Apart from seagoing mammals , all other acquatic creatures have a body temperature which is more or less the same as the ocean they 're swimming in . So there 's no body heat for infrared to pick up . So that leaves us with visible light . You 'd need a light that 's waterproof , which can withstand extraordinary pressures , and which is powerful enough to illuminate many metres of seawater ( bear in mind that even sunlight ca n't penetrate much more than 20 metres into the ocean ) . Even if you managed to design such a light and make it small enough to attach to a whale 's body , you 'd also need a battery for it . As anyone who owns a laptop or smartphone knows , generating light is one of the quickest ways to run down a battery . The battery required to power our hypothetical high - powered underwater light for many hours would be enormous . Finally , you 'd need to retrieve the camera once your whale has finished making its deepsea movie for you . So you 'd need to design something that automatically detaches when the whale surfaces , and will then float and send out a powerful - enough \" here I am \" radio signal for it to be picked up even if it 's thousands of miles out in the ocean .

You have a pen that can draw anything in that space , and you have a rule book that creates all of the rules for that world . Let 's say that you really want to see a sword fight in your world , so you draw two swords . After you 're done drawing , you realize that they 're just floating there , so you create a rule to have them swing at each other . So these swords start swinging , but you see that they just pass through each other . They do n't stop and bounce off each other because your rulebook only says to swing , it says nothing about bouncing off of each other when they touch . So you have to create a rule that says that if the two swords touch , they have to stop their movement and bounce off each other . First you have to create a rule that determines what touching means . Then you create a rule about how to tell if the two things are touching . Then you create a rule about what to do when those two things touch . Not content with your clashing swords , you decide that you need create a much more elaborate fight . So you draw a couple of knights , some horses , a shield or two , and a fancy background . As you build more and more , you realize you have to create a lot more rules . Everything has to be defined . Suddenly there are a lot of rules and a lot of objects you have to keep track of . That 's a lot of thinking you have to do ! So you have an idea . You realize that you do n't really care if the cloud you drew up in the sky bumps into a tree and bounces the right way , right ? It 's a waste of time to keep checking to make sure the cloud follows the rules about bouncing the right way , so you decide to take away the rule about clouds bouncing off objects . Now you do n't have to worry about tracking the clouds , and you can focus on drawing other things and making sure everything else is following the rules you wrote . That 's an oversimplification , but that 's pretty much why hit detection is n't always done for all objects in games ; devoting resources to hit detection takes computational resources and may not be worth it . A computer does n't just \" know \" when two objects collide . If you 've got a sword with very complex geometry , and another sword with complex geometry , it takes a lot of math to determine if any part of either sword is touching any other part of the other sword . In many instances , those kind of calculations have to be done for every object in every frame . In your example ( the gun through the vest ) , it would take a lot of math to not only determine where your gun and vest were colliding , but also to calculate where the objects should be relative to each other . There is probably a hit box ( the geometric shape that is tracked for hit detection ) around the player and the gun , but it probably does n't include all of the details of the vest , because that intricate geometry would be hard to track .","100 % accurate collision detection is extremely processing power intensive work for a computer so much so that it 's not an option for real time video games . There would just be to many checks that would need to be made to see if things are colliding instead game so devs use extremely simplified collisions shapes ( like rectangles to approximate a human body ) that are rarely accurate to the object in question . Many objects in the game world just simply wo n't have collision detection enabled period to reserve processing power . In the case your talking about it 's likely that the clothing has no collision detection and the animations are likely mostly canned instead of procedural . Both would need to be true in order for the game to notice the clipping and to modify the character model to prevent it . It would n't be a problem if the game only had a static set of gear but since that game has a massive amount of customization it really stands out since they parent gon na enable collision or alter the animations for every single little piece of clothing as that would be a massive amount of work in itself . So answer to your question is the they ca nt because we do n't have enough processing power to do it for a real time game . The same is true of many things when it comes to gaming so a lot of game development is fakery and optimization to create a just convincing enough world not necessarily a truly realistic one .","Particular objects in a character animation , such as the gun in a character 's hands , hardly if ever have collision applied to them . The devs likely got that animation with motion capture . If the actor was not wearing a similarly - bulky vest when doing the movements , it wo n't translate perfectly in the character . All the game recognizes is the animation skeleton of invisible \" bones \" that move ; everything else follows that . So yeah . It 's possible to do better , but not really worth it to eliminate all clipping .

When you have a headache , it is generally some sort of pressure on those areas that do have pain receptors . You feel the pulsating feeling because of your heart pumping blood to the area with pressure . With each heartbeat , the blood flowing to the area adds to the pressure , periodically causing you to feel the headache . The sensitivity to different stimuli can occur because each of those senses activates a region in the brain . When a brain region is active , it requires more blood flow ( this can be imaged using functional brain scans ) . If the headache is caused by pressure near those sensory areas on the brain , then additional stimulus to those senses will increase blood flow and thus , increase the pressure to those areas .","As someone who has suffered migraines since the age of 12 , am now in my 40 's .

This causes a painful sensation on the nerves in these areas . It takes a long time for these toxins to be cleaned up , hence the long and terrible migraines headaches .

Some of the matter in this case changes into energy which is effectively what matter is made up of as evidenced by the E = mc^2 equation ( E = energy(Joule or kg*(m \/ s)^2 ) , m = mass(kg ) , c = speed of light(m \/ s ) ) Much of the matter stays intact as well . A larger , unstable radioactive atom naturally releases neutrons through decay . These neutrons get absorbed through other atoms which destabalize them , so they split creating a couple other smaller atoms and simultaneously release photons ( energy that interacts with matter , aka gamma radiation ) , neutrinos ( energy that does n't really interact with matter ) , electrons ( beta radiation ) , and neutrons ( neutron radiation ) . These neutrons that are released can interact with other radioactive isotopes around it , destabalizing them and causing many more subsequent reactions . All of this happens in fractions of a second in a nuclear bomb resulting in a major explosion , but a nuclear reactor uses fuel that requires the neutrons to slow down before they can be absorbed ( usually by bouncing around in water or some sort of other moderator ) , so it can take a little longer and is able to be controlled much better by adding other atoms that can absorb the neutrons before they go back into the fuel which evens out the amount of neutrons produced by fission to the amount of them that create another fission in a 1:1 ratio . This balace is called \" criticality \" in a nuclear reactor .","In nuclear fission , when a nucleus is split by high energy neutron , two things happen : first : parts of nucleus go on their merry way , acquiring electrons ( if conditions permit ) and get to be atoms of another element ( which one , depends on nuclei being split in the first place , among other factors ) . Second , some of mass is converted into energy , relasing a radiation ( i.e. a gamma ray photon ) in the process . Also , excess neutrons are sometimes relased ( those fuel the nuclear chain reaction in uranium for example - when they split another nuclei on hit , and so on until conditions start to preclude this process ) In nuclear fusion ( so , when a heavier element is created from lighter ones ) , two lighter nuclei are pushed together by temperature \/ pressure ( which has to be high to overcome nuclei - level repulsion forces ) , form a heavier nucleus .

Our hunting success was helped by acquiring voices for long distance communication through language , better tool making , which was in turn supported by developing higher intelligence , bigger brains . Over a couple million years of development our better nutrition grew a bigger animal . With wider hips on the female due to the bigger heads . It is due to natural selection in that men seem to naturally select women to breed with that are more beautiful according to the needs for survival . All animals select breeding stock according to how well the prospective mate represents the ideal for the breed . Beauty across most human cultures away from the equator favour lighter skin , lower body hair , hip waist ratio suitable to head size , smaller stature . Bigger men compete better amongst themselves for mates , and have some advantage as hunters . Look at different male body types to see where they fit in the range of hunting on wide savannahs or in tight forests , living on small rations versus fighting big prey like mastodons . Advantages to a smaller woman is less nourishment to provide , longer endurance of hard times . Selection for less hair is due to less parasites hiding near the skin and also because the move north favors clothing whilst the previous range favored loss of hair so the skin can sweat . Human ability to sweat for cooling enables us to outperform our prey over long distance hunting , and travel over large hunting territories . We also out perform other hunters with the same advantage , the furred animals lose heat through panting , and other minimalist ways , so heat build up from long term exercise is mitigated by the ability to do short burst ambushes . And do n't forget we are pretty big land predators on the planetary scale , only bears , lions , tigers are bigger off the top of my head . That heat advantage was adjusted by wearing clothing rather than shedding and re - growing fur every second day . As clothing improved , our hunting range widened north to the glaciers and even out to sea in boats .

That is completely correct , but that only looks at one aspect of the problem : curing it in an individual . But why has n't cancer been cured completely ... in * everyone * ? Well , that 's because everyone 's cancer is different . Your cancer is very different from my cancer . * Even if * we have cancer of the same organ or tissue , our cancers are different . That 's because cancer is a disease of genetics and everyone 's genes are very different . This means that everyone 's cancer is a different disease . So because of that , cancer will never be * * completely * * cured . Terrifying . I know . But that is n't the end of the story . We 've discovered * some * similarities between cancers in different people . Certain cancers take their cue to grow from certain hormones . For example , there is a very specific type of breast cancer which looks for estrogen or progesterone ( two different hormones in everyone 's bodies ) as a signal to grow in the same way that whenever you feel your stomach grumble , you eat . Whenever estrogen or progesterone touches those cells , the cell divides and the cancer grows . Scientists have shown that if you minimize the activity of estrogen or progesterone in your body , the cancer has fewer signals to grow and it causes the cancer to shrink ( and maybe even die out ) . This only shows up in certain cancers : a very specific type of breast cancer , a very specific type of ovarian cancer and a couple others . In those cancers , this may work as a possible cure or treatment , but again , everyone 's disease is different , so it might not work for a given individual and it definitely wo n't work in a cancer that does n't show those markers . Things like this show up in a lot of cancers , and so doctors and scientists try to attack them in order to beat cancer in an individual . But those drugs do n't always work and a patient may have a relapse . This happens for two reasons : 1 . The drug does n't work on the cancer because the patient 's cancer is different because of genetics or 2 . the cancer evolved to become immune to the treatment . Imagine two people fighting . One of them is slightly stronger ( John ) , so he wins , right ? But what if the weaker one ( Mike ) picks up a baseball \/ cricket bat ? He becomes stronger than the unarmed one , right ? But then , to fight back , John would create a shield to protect himself against the bat . Since the bat no longer works , Mike might pick up a gun that breaks through the shield , so to protect himself , John needs a bulletproof vest , right ? This increasing of protection is what happens in cancer . The doctors try stronger and stronger drugs , but the cancer evolves to be immune to those treatments . The doctors have to resort to even stronger drugs and the cancer finds better ways to avoid the treatments . At some point in time , the doctors have used all the drugs that are available to them and the cancer has won out . It happens from time to time . And at that point , there is n't much more a doctor can do . Once the cancer takes over an important organ , the patient passes away because their body just ca n't function anymore . So researchers are always looking for new drugs or treatments that work . But cancer keeps changing in each individual , as well as in the species as a whole with different cancers showing up . It 's sad that we will probably never completely cure cancer . It 's pretty much impossible . Maybe with the popularity of individualized medicine that is tailored to your genes specifically , we 'll be able to defeat cancer once and for all . A doctor would simply send out a sample of your tissue to scan for your DNA and then get a report with all of your genes . They would then be able to tailor their treatment specifically to you and not to these trends that researchers have found in the lab .","Because the cancer cells are your cells , but with the problem of copying uncontrollably . A lot of possible ways to kill cancer cells kill normal cells . The methods used today are pretty terrible , as they have major side effects . Cancer is not a single disease . And each of these vary based on genetics . Cancer is a fundamental problem for multicellular organisms ( living things that are made of more than one cell ) . A living thing needs to organize , use , and control its cells . Normally a cell 's cycle and behavior are tightly controlled to benefit the whole organism . A normal body generates cancerous cells , but they are usually destroyed .","It 's because cancerous cells are your own cells ! Your immune system ca n't distinguish them from regular healthy cells .

Abstraction is incredibly important for building complex programs or circuits because each level of abstraction brings an increased amount of overall complexity and there comes a certain point when it becomes unreasonable to necessitate that the user understand all the minute details of some function . Functions that have their inner workings hidden are often called \" black boxes . \" For all intents and purposes , the user just considers it to be this magic box where you put something in and you get something out . Sometimes it 's actually useful to understand on some level how the black box works because you can have two black boxes that do the same thing in different ways , and depending on the type of input you 're giving it , you might want to choose one over the other due to efficiency concerns . Abstraction is n't just something computer scientists use , it 's used for computer circuits , networks , weather models , scientific theories , psychology , economics , business etc . You use abstraction every time you drive your car . You understand the inputs to the machine , your gas pedal to go faster , your brake to go slower , your gear shift to park , go in reverse or go forward , your steering wheel to change direction . Most people do n't really understand how cars work on a reductionist level , they just understand the high level idea of what input does what . I 'll give a less 5 year old explanation : consider computer circuits . The fundamental unit of the computer is the transistor . A transistor is simply a gate that either allows current to flow or turns that current off . If you put a few of these transistors together in certain configurations , you can create logical gates like AND , OR , NOR , XNOR , XAND , NAND etc ( Google these to see what they do ) . Using these gates , you can then build small circuits that output certain values given certain inputs . You can also make circuits that store information ( these are called flip flops ) . You can make circuits using these flip flops and logic to create circuits that can add two numbers , that can make RAM , you can make circuits that display an image on a screen , and all the other things that computers can do . Each level of abstraction : * the transistor ( which is itself an abstraction of quantum physics ) * The logic gate ( you do n't have to worry about how the transistors are configured to make the gate ) * The logic circuit ( you do n't have to worry about how the logic gates are configured ) * The functional circuit like an adder , a CPU , a GPU ( you * generally * do n't need to worry about exactly how all the individual components are configured to make the complex circuit ) Using abstraction , we are able to create programs and circuits and models of soaring complexity .","Say I make two classes with direct references to each other . This makes them tightly coupled , hindering them to be used individually elsewhere in the code . This often leads to the having to rewrite parts of code in other areas and making it a nightmare when you have to update the code a year later and only remember to update in once place . It also makes it difficult to test either class by itself , so debugging means effectively treating the two as a larger , more complex class . So the solution to this problem is to use abstraction to keep classes decoupled . You make an interface or abstract class that provides or describes some base functionality , and then anything implementing those can be used in operations throughout the code . This allows easier modification and testing , as you can add and remove classes without having to update existing code that operates on the abstracted level . And you can test the generic - handling code without relying on specific implementations of various classes . A basic example is sorting things . The sorting algorithm does n't care what the things actually are , just what the outcome is when you compare two of them to each other . So making that an interface with some compare function , you can now implement a sorting algorithm that works with anything that implements that interface . Or perhaps message parsing . If you know your messages all build off an abstract class telling what kind of message they are and how big they are , the parser can look at this abstract level to obtain the relevant data to pass the message on to the appropriate parsing function . Or even further , perhaps the abstract class also has virtual methods to parse data , so now a generic message handler can tell the message to parse , knowing that all implementations know how to do that .","Think of how you use a car . When you get in a car , do you think : \" Gee , if I put the correct key into the ignition , the notches will line up properly on the locking mechanism so that I can turn the key to start the car . This happens because the electricity from the battery ..... [two hours later ] ... so then I can actually drive . \" No , to you , a car is \" Start it , steer it , speed up , slow down , shut it off -- and sometimes gas up \" . Abstraction , in computer science , is similar . If you wrote an interface for a car , it would have just a few functions : Start(input : key ) Steer ( direction : [ left \/ right ] ) Accelerate ( ) Brake ( ) GasUp(fuel ) Maintenance(PreferredMechanic ) As a user , you do n't need to know much else to successfully own a car . So the idea of abstraction is to hide as many details about how the thing actually works so that users have a clear , well - defined interface . The benefit is if a new [ engine \/ algorithm ] comes along , the users do n't need to learn anything new , they still just use your [ car \/ program ] the same way .

Five years later that small amount you once owed can now be huge . Americans get to choose how many exemptions their employer should assume they 'll have when they do their taxes . We all do it when we start any full - time job . However , lots of people with 1 exemption prefer to tell their employer 2 - 3 exemptions instead . This means they get more money each paycheck but will owe the IRS more money out of pocket at the end . The theory is that the end result is the same , but this way you get to earn interest until Apr 15 on that money instead of the IRS earning interest on it . However , even for young , relatively low income workers , this can easily mean they owe a grand or three in taxes out of pocket at the end of the year . For the rest of us , it 's very easy to end up owing thousands of dollars at the end of each tax year . This is doubly true for anyone who is married . When your employer deducts taxes from your paycheck , they are making an educated guess that you will be in the tax bracket that your yearly income from them would put you in . However , if your spouse makes appreciably more than you , then you owe more ( because they pulled you up into a higher tax bracket ) , but your employer does n't know it . That means you 're going to owe money ( often thousands of dollars ) at the end of the year . The same is true if you just got a big raise mid - way through the year --- half of your checks had taxes deducted at a lower tax bracket , and so the end result will be off . You do n't pay that just once ( or screw up your taxes and miss a big $ 2k adjustment , like you did n't realize that you now make enough that alternative minimum tax applies to you , or you mis - read the instructions and thought you could deduct your home 's new microwave as part of your home office ) , then suddenly you owe money to the IRS in back taxes .

You 're essentially asking about what comedy is . A lot of old definitions hark back to such ideas ( young versus old , for instance ) . Comedians , specifically some of the best , talk about absurdities in reality , or inject absurdity into reality by taking turns you would n't expect . A lot of times it 's about breaking the cooperative principle of language - which is to say , when people communicate , they 're cooperating . Otherwise nothing they say would make sense . If you ask for the time and I say my phone is dead , years ago that would have made no sense . But now it does , and you have to cooperate intrinsically to understand that I 'm helping you with more information . Comedians often break these rules on purpose to mislead people from reality into absurdity . They set up a premise , and then \" tweak it \" . How an individual comedian works though , that can change . You 'd have to ask comedians themselves . I 'd love to try stand - up myself but I just never found the time or courage thus far .","I 'm an aspiring comedian . 26 y \/ o and I 've been writing one - liner jokes my whole life , I have 4 or 5 thousand . As far as \" comedy writing \" you do n't plan on performing goes , just get a piece of paper and pen and start writing , like ' free styling ' and never let the pen stop moving . Try to be funny in your stream of thought and fill out a page . This overall makes you a funnier person , when you look back and reread it you 'll see 6 or 7 ' concepts ' that you can now reword more succinctly into a joke . It also sharpens your mind so that you can be funny more consistently and for longer , and that will reflect in your spoken words in conversation . As far as writing one - liner jokes go , see an object that you find peculiar , then just think about it , think about what relates to it , think of what is obscure about it and then put it one sentence . After you write 500 of those , spanning many different topics , pick out the 50 best ones or pair the jokes that share a common topic and reword them ( if possible ) so they fit more like a puzzle piece . This is how I do it and I think this is how Mitch Hedberg did it . When he says 3 one - liners in a row that are all on the same topic , it 's likely that he wrote them at 3 different times , maybe years apart . This is an essential part of being a comedian , holding as many jokes in your working memory that you can and then recalling them upon the realization that they mesh well with other jokes\/ topics , or saying them aloud in conversation ( it seemed so RANDOM of you to say that , but it 's a joke you 've been subconsciously holding on to ) for that sweet gratifying laughter .

In short , speed tests are conducted by simply retrieving a file from a server for calculating download speeds and then sending files back to the server for calculating upload speeds . Usually this is done in a short period of time ( such as 2 - 10s ) , and big files are not necessarily needed to make this measurement . Modern speed tests are actually able to change dynamically the amount of data downloaded based on the initial results , so a faster internet would download more data so it can accurately calculate your speed . Think of it like this : let 's suppose you have a 4 megabits per second download speed on your phone . When you touch \" start test \" , your phone will try to download a 1 megabyte file . Since it 1 megabyte is equal to 8 megabits , it should take 2 seconds to download the file . Now if you were to have a 400 megabits per second connection , downloading a 1 megabyte file would take only 0.02 seconds ... this is not enough time to make an average , so a bigger file would be needed in this case to accurately measure your speed .

Lets say that you are a car and that you drink milk to make you go . There are three different kinds of milk for this example : skim ( 0 % fat ) , 1 % , and 2 % . These would be the same as regular , plus , and premium . Now there are different kinds of people out there . Most of them are regular or overweight . They do n't need the extra fat in the milk so giving them skim is just fine . It 's not a bad thing to give them 1 % or 2 % but it does n't make them more athletic . But there are some people out there who are pretty athletic . They need a little more fat in their diet or they would not be able to be as active . So those people need to drink 1 % . Then there are people that are the real Olympic style athletes . They need to go really fast and have a lot of physical ability . So they need the 2 % milk or they will just not be able to do what they need to . That 's pretty much how it works with cars . If you want a more scientific reason , look at some of the other posts . They are correct . There is no advantage to buying gasoline that is higher octane than what your car needs so just buy what you need because it 's cheaper .","Because you asked in explain like I 'm five , not askscience : Different gases have different boom - boom explosion types and engines are designed to use a specific type . ' Premium ' is not necessarily better than ' regular ' . Get whatever your car recommends .","Gasoline grade refers to the octane rating of the gasoline . The higher the octane rating , the more \" stable \" the fuel is . By stable I mean how much it will resist detonation . Detonation is just the term used to describe the fuel self - igniting - burning before the engine wants to ignite it . This is bad because it puts stress on the engine components , wastes fuel and you ultimately lose power . Detonation is _ very _ bad for your engine . Now , why do n't all engines use the same octane ? Because not every one of them is built with the same thing in mind . Sports cars have high performance engines , requiring high octane fuel . Engineers can extract more reliable performance out of an engine running on higher octane fuel than lower octane fuel . Your average commuter car was n't designed with horsepower as a big consideration , so regular fuel is fine . Running low octane fuel in an engine that requires high octane fuel is bad . The engine ( I 'm sure some can , but for the sake of argument ) ca n't really reconfigure itself for lower octane fuels so it just keeps trying to run on bad fuel . Higher octane fuel also allows for a safety margin in sports cars that are tuned to the bleeding edge . A recent gearhead trend is to use ethanol , which has an octane rating of 108 and crank up the horsepower . tldr ; Some engines are designed for power and not the cost of fuel . These engines require better gas that can withstand the additional stress that high performance engines are under ."],"11674":["poker is a very complicated game , full of subtleties and nuances , its not a game of luck , its a game of skill . over the short term , you can get very lucky , or very unlucky , but the distribution of hands over the long term is the same for everybody , so you 'll naturally see better players do better over the long term .

If you bet too little , everyone will be temped to call and you 're more likely to lose to someone who had a mediocre hand , but drew some really good cards . And you ca n't just always bet when you have good cards , or smart players will see this pattern and always fold when you bet and when you do n't bet , they 'll raise and force you to either call with bad cards or fold . So , you have to mix up your betting , too .

Sometimes the connectivity is sparse - e.g. with NYC , you 've got TWC , and if you are lucky , Verizon FiOS .

Thus , the courts logic flies in the face of reality , as far as what consumers actually face today - they go so far to say that because Google Fiber has entered the market , that there are clear signs that there is healthy competition . Google Fiber , a service that Google itself has stated ( to my knowledge ) is not meant as competition for ISPs , nor will be expanded greatly beyond its current prospects .

The Conservative & Unionist Party is their full current name and they are the current Government in both the Lords and the Commons , the Government in the Lords is n't important . They are also the Second Party in Y Senedd ( Welsh Parliament ) and Scots Parlaiment . The Conservative Party was formed in 1834 , following an awful election ressult for the Tories in 1832 . The Tories were the right wing party from 1678 - 1832 . Tory is a term used to describe a Conservative in the UK , it can be both used as an insult and a positive gesture . A specific insult with Tory is Red Tory , in the UK red is the Socialist colour and used by the Labour Party . Red Tory reffers to a Labour member who is to the right of the Labour Party , such as their former leader and Prime Minister Tony Blair , the only living Labour leader to win an election . The Conservatives are a large right wing party with many factions it is however right wing . The Tories believe in smaller government and lower taxes , however May ( current leader ) may try to increase several taxes , she has been iffy on the matter . I assume you are American so to relate it to America the Conservative & Unionist Party is similar to the Democrats ( right wing of the party ) and Republicans ( left wing of the party ) . The Conservatives have since the 70s ( Thatcher ) have been pro - free trade gloabilists . They are also often viewed as the bussiness party , I d argure they are n't due to their current hard line on Brexit which could cost British Bussiness at least \u00a3 20 Billion accoriding to most studies . The Conservatives also have liberal factions ( similar to the Libertarian Party ) . * * * * Labour is the * Socialist * Party . Labour flirts with socialism and has till recently been more to the right however Corbyn won the Leadership contest in 2015 , a big suprise and he nearly did n't get on the ballot . He defended the title following a coup in 2016 . Labour currently lead the Most Loyal Opposition ( biggest opposition party ) in both the Lords and Commons . They control the Government in Y Senedd and 3rd in Soctland , till very recently Scotland was Labour heartland . Labour believe in high tax high spend policies , Labour have currently suggested borowing \u00a3 500 Billion to invest in the UK . Labour are too far too the left for a comparison to the US for the most part , the right of the Labour Party is similar to the left of the Democrats . The Labour Party is currently in a fairly open civil war . A coup in 2016 showed that 40\/229 MPs backed Corbyn . Corbyn has massively increased membership in Labour and has got the Hard Left in control of Labour for the first time in a long time . Often the hard left fringe parties try to take over labour . As a damning fact the Communist Party are n't standing in any seat for the first time and are backing Labour . Labour have an arangement with the Social Labour Democratic Party meaning Labour does n't stand in Northern Ireland and the SDLP do n't stand in Great Britian . Labour have an arangement with the Co - Op Party meaning a Labour member can stand as Labour or Labour & Co - Op . * * * * We have other parties too ; The Liberal Democrats . The Liberal Democrats are the traditional third party in the UK , used to be the main party or second party till the Lloyd Ministry 1916 - 1922 . The Liberal Democrats formed from The Liberal Party led by Steel and The SDP ( a Labour split off ) and the gang of four . The Lib Dems were hammered in 2010 for what was seen as a betrayal when in Coalition tuition fees trippled after they promised to end tuition fees , personally I think that was the better outcome at the time but many were angry .

Then some jackass invented the camera , and suddenly this amazing skill was pretty useless . If someone wanted a picture that looked like the real world they could get it quicker and easier with a camera . Hell , after a few decades they could take the pictures themselves and completely cut out the artist . \" I want a picture of a pretty waterfall ! \" Used to require you to find a super talented artist and pay him a lot of money to paint or draw it . But after the camera anyone could find a waterfall and take its picture . And then they could make thousands of those same pictures and sell them . This made artists and the whole art world freak the fuck out . Suddenly they were useless right ? Well , not really . See they still had worked for years and years to good at what they did . These people know a shit ton about making pictures . To you or me , it might seem like they were really good at making pictures \" that look like the real world . \" But that is n't actually the case , they were actually real good at layering paint ( , or charcoal , or any medium I will just use paint tho ) onto a flat surface and making it look how they wanted it . But in the past they had focused almost entirely on making this complex use of paint look like the real world . They soon figured out that they could use all these complex techniques and tricks that they had once used to make pictures that looked like the real world to make pictures that look like anything but the real world . They could make pictures of pure thoughts , or emotions or of impossible concepts . And so they did and people liked it . Here is the thing that Modern Art taught us , anything can be art . And that means that anyone can draw a red square and call it art . But it better be a really awesome red square , because out there is someone that has trained for 2 decades to be an artist . He knows how to layer other colors under the red of the square so the color seems \" off \" and creates a sense of tension . He knows how to blend the paint into the canvas so the square does n't seem to be simply on the canvas , but it seems to emerge from it . He knows how add texture to his brush strokes , so that the simplicity of the red square is full of complex and intriguing cross hatch of lines . Anyone can make a red square and hell you might get lucky and make something interesting by accident . But you are n't just trying to make a red square , you are trying to make a red square that stands above every other red square in the world , and if you can pull that off , you are an artist .","From an academic standpoint , \/u \/ gargle_ground_glass answer is good , and might I add to clarify even further : \" Anyone can draw a red square , but not that particular red square ...

The real problem with this is that it has to be explained . And , like a bad joke , if it has to be explained , it probably is n't funny . That being said ... Very very very little of the modern art you see in museums are done in a vacuum . This is why it is different from Renaissance art and older stuff , most of which was done for the purpose of commissions for churches and such , not to make a commentary on anything . But , again , the modern art requires explanation , and this is the weakness that some find , it ca n't exist in a vacuum : it is forced to accompany the time in which it was made . Van Gogh , Rembrandt , Monet , DaVinci , Michaelangelo : these guys created art that could withstand time . A red square in a modern art gallery must always be accompanied by explanation ( time , date , circumstances , painter , location , etc ) ... otherwise it is just a red square . And , no , you 're not supposed to understand that \" Untitled Red Square \" is a commentary on the plight of bumblebees in Eastern Africa : this is a gallery or artist being pretentious . Furthermore ... It is not unusual for that \" red square \" to be drawn with the purpose of being hung in a gallery or purchased \u2013 basically for the fame of the artist \u2013 but the gallery is unlikely to hang anything for exclusively that purpose . Having heard this description from many a gallery : \" We are hanging it for exposure . \" What they mean is that they believe that the artist did it for a reason , for a purpose , they agree with the reason , believe it should have exposure , and so they hang it ... Or ... at least , that was the way it used to be ... Remember how I said modern art comments on the contemporary ? Then you get artists like Piero Manzoni and Terence Koh who actually are unusual because they are creating modern art to comment on modern art ! The infamous example is the gold plated poop , where the artist literally dipped his shit in gold and put it up for sale for a astronomical sum of money , basically to subversively comment on the fact that art has lost its meaning and that people are willing to literally buy gold shit if it is from the right artist .

African Americans * do * commit crimes at a significantly higher rate than whites , but much of this has to do with socio - economic conditions that have resulted from their unique history . Most African Americans are the descendants of slaves . After the Civil War , most slaves became sharecroppers ; they were technically \" free \" , but still lived incredibly poorly and often tilled the same plantation they were once enslaved on . This was n't a choice on their part so much as it was a necessity . In other words , things did n't change much for many ex - slaves . Fast - forward one hundred years , and blacks in the US were still subjected to a number of social disadvantages , especially in the south ( which is where most black Americans live ) . Many blacks lived in impoverished urban ghettos , and were unable to secure certain jobs , send their kids to good public schools , etc . Neighborhoods designated as \" white \" would prevent black families from moving in , even if they had the money . It was n't until the 50s and 60s that the Civil Rights movement began to get rolling and made considerable gains for blacks . But the important thing to remember is that this was n't very long ago ; two generations at most . The legacy of Jim Crowe is still alive and well , and the black community has not had enough time to recover from the economic effects of the social barriers they faced for most of our nation 's history . The result : the average black family has less money and lives in a less affluent neighborhood than the average white family . Black children grow up in crime - infested areas with sub - par public schools and a lack of access to positive role models . They grow up poor , and the cycle perpetuates . This poverty breeds a higher crime rate . So it 's true that blacks commit crimes at a higher rate than whites . But it 's important to remember the historical and socioeconomic reasons for this phenomenon .

Teenagers and young adults in particular , and especially those who wears coats that are two times bigger than what they should wear . Not only those coats are a shoplifting tool , but since they wear that all the time in the street anyway , we can not spot those with a large coat that will steal from those who wo n't . The good thing is that their techniques were different from whites . The 10 % ( more like 5 % ) of white people that steals there used * * complex * * techniques , subterfuges and planing . They plan ahead and are sometimes criminal masterminds , they will steal for thousand of dollars before we even find out .

Imagine a hill and a ball . The hill is a little bit special , it has a small groove at the top so that the ball can sit there stabily , but the grove is n't so deep that you ca n't push it over and down the hill . Now , there are a couple key states to note : The ball being at the top of the hill , and the ball being at the bottom of the hill . If the ball starts in either of those states , it kinda just sits there . However , if you decide to push the ball out of its groove and down the hill , it will have a lot of energy by the time it reaches the bottom of the hill , which will be released into whatever it hits . This is kind of how bombs work as well . Non - nuclear ( conventional ) bombs use chemical reactions ( reactions between atoms ) . The chemicals inside the bomb are capable of being in multiple states . By design , they are first in the high energy state ( ball on top of hill ) , before before being pushed into a low energy state ( ball bottom of hill ) . This transformation is from one set of chemicals to another set of chemicals , releasing lots of energy in the process . Nuclear bombs are pretty much the same , except instead of the changes of state happening between atoms , it happens within atoms . After an atom gets to about the size of an iron atom , it gets harder and harder to pack more protons and neutrons onto it ( it 's like pushing the ball up the hill ) , so when some manage to get knocked away , it releases energy . Pound per pound this actually releases A LOT of energy compared to chemical reactions , which is why nuclear weapons are so much stronger . As for nuclear fallout , it 's still pretty similar . Nuclear weapons release \/ create a lot of atoms that are unstable . They have a bad neutron \/ proton balance and are akin to a ball on the top of a hill with just a itty bitty groove , that is very easily knocked into releasing its energy ( technically , it does n't require a knock , just time ) . This release of energy can happen when the atom is a part of human cells , or can just pass through and knock some things around . This actually happens all the time because the world is filled with radiation , but too much of it can be hard for your body to handle , causing cancer and other issues .","Normal chemical reactions do n't affect the number and type of atoms present in a system . However , in larger atoms , the bonds the nucleus of an atom contain a significant amount of energy . A fission weapon attempts to exploit this by firing neutrons at a semi - stable atom ( like uranium 235 ) , creating an unstable product that splits into new atoms . These new atoms are also often unstable , but decay over longer times , giving rise to nuclear fallout .","There 's a force that keeps atoms bound together ( called the strong nuclear force ) . It 's powerful enough to overcome the electromagnetic forces that would otherwise push protons away from each other . When a nuclear warhead detonates , a number of the molecules are split , releasing the nuclear binding energy that was holding them together . Once one molecule does this , the flying particles hit others and cause them to do the same , resulting in a cascade of molecules splitting in a very short amount of time . All this energy results in a huge explosion . The fallout of a single nuke is n't incredibly dangerous if the bomb detonates in the air ( as the two used in WW2 were ) since the radioactive debris is blown away and dispersed by wind and water relatively quickly . However , should a nuke detonate at ground level , radioactive material will mix with dirt and settle , causing elevated levels of radiation in the area ."],"8932":["They would claim self defense , and most likely win .","It depends on a lot .

In the case of rape or sexual assault , however , the act itself is not criminal by nature . The same act can be legal or illegal and it 's largely dependent on how the other person reacts psychologically to the sexual activity \/ advances .

Proving that the sexual partner did not want to have sexual relations with that individual at that time of the offense is the challenge . You basically have to prove the victim 's state of mind at the time of the offense , either by convincing the court that the victim was too psychologically impaired to consent to those activities or by convincing the court that the victim did not provide consent and the offender continued anyway despite the victim 's unwillingness to engage in such acts .

They are lots of reasons rapes go unreported for a long period of time , but when it does happen , it is almost impossible to convict someone . Next is the fact that most rapes are not what most people think . A rape where a criminal breaks into someones house or grabs them off the street and commits the crime are actually very rare . When these do happen it is very easy for it to be investigated and prosecuted like any other crime . But these kinds of rapes are the extreme minority . 82 % of rapes are committed by someone the victim knows .

Now if there is physical evidence of struggle , or witnesses that say the accused was acting aggressive or something like that , than they * might * be able to get a conviction .

Being choosy means being able to pay them less and getting higher quality . That 's a good deal to a company ! Furthermore , if I 'm extremely wealthy , like Mark Zuckerberg owning > $ 1b in Facebook stock wealthy , I can do weird stuff like take out a $ 100 m loan to buy a house using my Facebook stock as collateral . Note that since I never cashed out the stock , I do n't have to pay taxes on it . he only needs to pay interest on the loan . Meanwhile , the house appreciates in value faster than payments on the interest . He 's basically making money without using any money and without getting taxed ! And then , as the value of the house increases , he can do it again , this time using the house itself as collateral for something else he wants to buy , like a yacht or something . Paying 20 % on normal income is meaningless at that level of wealthy . Yet , as many other people point out , at lower incomes , paying 20 % is extremely difficult . It means the difference between being able to buy a car or else be trapped paying bus and train fares to go to work . However , I thought I 'd like to point out what it 's like at the opposite end of the spectrum . As you * have * more money , there are more ways to make money and avoid paying as much tax . People who make less also have less and are not able to take advantage of various financial options that are available to people with money .

Diesel fuel burns slower , giving a longer power stroke , making it better at low speed - high torque situations ( think like big trucks or heavy equipment ) . In car engines , this high torque , low RPM means that it does n't accelerate as much , but can convert more of the fuel added in the engine to power by better using the oxygen in the air . When you add a turbo charger to the diesel engine , you can burn completely almost all of the diesel fuel , minimizing dangerous biproducts like carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons . In essence , they 'll produce the same overall power as a gasoline engine , but use less fuel doing it and therefore produce less greenhouse gas . So , in summary , diesel advantages are better gas mileage , cleaner emissions , better power ( more torque ) at slower speeds ( for pulling things , doing work , climbing hills , etc ) , and on occasion costing less for gas . Relative disadvantages : In North America diesel costs more than gasoline because it 's more fuel efficient ( the oil companies get you ) , they accelerate more slowly , and they can cost more for repairs , depending on whether it 's a foreign or domestic vehicle . In North America , where diesel 's are rarer , it can sometimes be harder to find a mechanic that will work on it , while in Europe diesel mechanics are much more common .","In general , diesel vehicles tend to last longer and get better gas mileage . For instance , my diesel VW gets better than 40 MPG , and my honda civic gets about 28 .

In a gasoline engine , the gas - air mixture is injected into the chamber , and then after it 's compressed just an instant after the point of * maximal * compression , it 's ignited with a spark plug . In a diesel engine , the diesel - air mixture is injected into the chamber , and then as the piston approaches the point of * maximal * compression , it auto - ignites from the pressure .

They also generate more power because of it . However , there 's a catch . Because the fuel - air mixture detonates * before * the maximum compression , this stresses out the piston as it has to power through the igniting fuel - air mixture through the end of it 's compression cycle , and only then can it take advantage of the ignited fuel to power the engine .

First , in national elections , the states in the US are \" winner take all \" . If you win a state 's election and you get 55 % of the votes , you get all of that state 's votes , and not just 55 % of them . This makes it very easy to have one or two strong parties , but makes it very difficult to have three strong parties . A strong third party would not be able to become important just by winning a lot of votes in a lot of states . Winning 30 % of the vote in every state but coming in second or third would be less effective than winning 51 % of the vote in the smallest state . The other reason is that both of these parties agree on a lot of things and are able to argue against anyone who does n't believe in what the Democratic and Republican parties agree on . The reason they are treated as if they are very different on TV and in the newspapers is because of \" partisan politics \" . \" Partisan \" means \" supporter \" . In partisan politics , \" winning \" is often the most important thing . It 's often more important than an agenda , or whatever reason you wanted to \" win \" for in the first place . Partisan Democrats and partisan Republicans talk about one another as if they were almost always wrong , and sometimes as if they were downright evil . Partisan politics is like turning politics into sports . One team will win , either \" your team \" or \" the other team \" . In American football , it does n't matter if you agree that the opponent 's quarterback is a very good person who plays the game well , you still want your team to win . One result of this is that in the news , politics is usually covered by telling you who 's \" winning \" opinion polls , or who 's probably going to win the election , rather than letting you know what each person stands for and letting you decide between them . This is often called \" horse race politics \" , because it covers who 's coming out ahead rather than what anyone actually wants to accomplish once they win an election . As far as what the Democrats and Republicans agree on , quite honestly , it 's most things ! Most Republicans and Democrats believe that capitalism is very important , that \" real \" campaign finance reform is bad ( campaign finance reform would mean that businesses would be able to give less money to politicians to run for office ) , that whatever the government does about the economy should result in less unemployment and less inflation ( the problem is that sometimes what you do to \" fix \" one hurts the other ) , that we should lower crime , and in basic freedom .

Let 's say that 4 kids like carrots , and 6 kids like sweets ( 3 like ice cream , 3 like cotton candy ) . Even though more people like sweets than carrots , if everyone votes for their preference , carrots will win because more people chose it than any other option . The only way for a sweet thing to be chosen is for people to change how they would like to vote to keep from getting stuck with carrots . This explains how people associate with one party as well - since there are only two options to choose from ( sweet things or healthy things ) , everyone has to pick which one is more like what they prefer and stick with that one . Some people may not like carrots very much but they prefer to eat healthy foods over sweet foods , so they will vote for carrots just to keep sweet things from winning . It 's not * ideal * for them to have carrots , but it 's better than the alternative . Some people may like something sweet and healthy - like grapes or strawberries or cantaloupe - and so they 're stuck in the middle . Whichever way they vote , they do n't quite get what they want , but they never gain any traction on their own . Now , in this situation , both parties agree on certain things . Everybody wants to eat * something * for snacktime , and everybody has particular reasons for choosing what they want to eat . Both people can make very good arguments for why their snack is better than the other snack , and some people will get very angry about whose snack is better - they might even start making fun of the other kids for liking the \" wrong \" snack ! This is because snacktime is very important in this class , and some people like making very important decisions . It 's a little hard to describe the parties with snacks , but I 'd like to call the Republicans the \" sweets \" and the Democrats the \" healthies . \" Democrats like to make sure that everyone is healthy and strong so that they can be the kids that they should be , without any extra weight holding them down - this should ideally keep everyone close to the same level of happy , without too many highs or lows . Republicans want to make sure that people can be happy in their own special way without anyone telling them what to do - this can end up with some people carrying a lot more than other people , which makes some kids happy and other kids sad .

Depending on the playback software that you are using , you can expect this time period to be relatively constant . In contrast , if you are playing a video game , each picture will typically be displayed as long as it takes your graphics card to render the next one . The human visual perception is very sensible to small differences in these display times ( jitter ) , causing the motion to appear to \" stutter \" more than a video where each frame is displayed for 1\/60th of a second . Note that this scenario only applies when your graphics card renders as fast or slow as it wants \/ can , i.e. , \" VSnyc \" is off . When VSync is on , i.e. , when you force your graphics card to output as many pictures per second as your monitor displays ( say , 60 for a monitor with a refresh rate of 60 Hz ) , all frames will be displayed for the same amount of time , but there may still be some stuttering ( when your graphics card is very slow ; out of scope here ) . However , it may still be that you experience a game with 60 frames per second to be not as smooth as a video . But this has nothing to do with the way the video is compressed ( e.g. , a certain video format like H.264 ) - unless there are very severe compression artifacts . What comes into play here is how the video has been recorded . If the camera recorded the video with 60 frames per second , the \" movement \" of objects between two frames is blurred due to the way capturing works typically ( no details here , but the term motion blur has been mentioned in other comments , if you are interested ) .

An A on either is not a single frequency , it is a \" fundamental \" and a bunch of multiples of that frequency , called \" overtones \" . Together they make up the timbre of that instrument . Different instruments have different overtones . Of course , they may also have other characteristics , such as the rate of attack ( how the volume grows from zero to full amplitude ) and decay ( the opposite ) .","Two main things differentiate different sounds that have the same frequency . One is the \" shape \" of the sound . In nature , the shape of the frequency is likely to be a sine - wave . On a graph it would be a snake - like shape . Electronically generated sounds can have different shapes , like a square - wave , sawtooth - wave , or whatever . Second is the overtones . Suppose the frequency is middle C , at 262 beats per second . One instrument might have a strong overtone at the next C up , with a frequency of 524 beats per second . Another instrument might have hardly any sound there , but a strong overtone at the next C above that . We hear the lowest frequency as the note , and we hear the shape and the overtone as information about the kind of instrument that created that note .","Three main things : * Timbre ( Which overtones - I 'll explain what those are soon - are most present in the sound ) * Envelope . This describes the amplitude shape of the sound - how hard is the attack , how long does the attack stay that way , how long does the sound last , and how quickly does the sound decay ? In a synthesizer , you can control all of these components through something called ADSR ( Attack - Decay - Sustain - Release ) . * Additional Noise ( The sound of the guitar amp hum , the squeak of a piano pedal , the rosin of the bow on the violin string , etc ) Now , Timbre . Notes are made of vibrations . Imagine a vibrating string . That string vibrates along its entire length , but it also vibrates along divisions of that length . The smaller the divisions , the higher the notes . This means that inside of every note you hear are several , fainter , higher notes . These are called partials , overtones , or harmonics . An instrument 's timbre is decided largely by the * balance * of those overtones . A flute , for example , has a very pure overtone expression with mostly lower , consonant ( meaning , for ELI5 purposes , \" pleasant \" ) partials . This gives it a clear sound . A distorted electric guitar , by contrast , has a lot of presence in its higher partials , which gives it more of a jagged quality . This is an over - simplified version , but all you need to know is that the overtone pattern determines much of the quality of the sound . You can actually hear the overtone series in your own voice , because each vowel brings out a different overtone . Sing a medium - low note in your range , clearly , and switch slowly between \" ooh \" and \" ee \" - you should hear , faintly , a note above the note you 're singing that suddenly gets higher and louder when you sing the \" ee \" . If you get good enough at this , you can do what [ this weird awesome lady ] ( URL_0 ) does and sing two notes at the same time . The same thing that makes two of your vowels sound different - even though they 're almost identical sounds coming from the same voice - is what makes two instruments sound different : overtones . But what happens if two instruments have similar overtone profiles ? A trumpet and an oboe , for example , have almost identical timbres . Here we want to look at our envelope , particularly our attack . A trumpet has a very crisp , biting attack that 's very fast , while an oboe has a much more mellow attack . If we jump into the middle of an oboe or trumpet note , it 's hard to hear the difference - but that initial attack & sputter in the trumpet makes the difference very clear ! The vocal equivalent of this would be consonants . Finally , noise . In addition to the overtone series and the envelope , there are all sorts of noises that go along with a sound that we may not consider as musical but are nonetheless important . The sound of additional air coming through a trumpet , the rattle in somebody 's voice when they sing a note too early in the morning , the buzz of a guitar amplifier . Our ear takes all of these clues , puts them together , and - voila ! - you 've perceived not just what the note is , but what kind of instrument is making the note !"],"13002":["There are those that believe if everything was open source we could improve it all together and progress faster .

Your body uses them as the main storage form of fat in your body . They are also a main component of LDL , otherwise known as bad cholesterol . When your blood levels are too high ( I suspect this is what your doctor was talking about ) , you run the risk of developing plaques in your blood vessels . Like precordial_thump said , these plaques cause blockages in your vessels which can cause many problems like heart attacks and strokes . Start taking fish oil , which increases HDL , or good cholesterol . Do n't eat too much junk . If your levels stay high , statins ( i.e. Lipitor ) are great at reducing LDL and have recently gone off patent so they are very cheap .","Think of your blood vessels like a slide at a playground .

In this sense they are largest the energy reserve for the body . Energy storage is good for our bodies , but remember too much of a good thing is n't always good . Below are separate explanations for why triglycerides are bad . Excess triglycerides are known to be main cause of diabetes type II . When your fat cells start to store too much , your body realizes that there 's something wrong . Your own immune system detects this and start attaching to these fat cells . They start releasing signals to tell your fat cells to release more triglycerides into the blood stream . These fats can go through the body and signal your muscles to take up the fats instead of glucose ( your body 's main energy source ) . This causes too much glucose build up in your blood , and that in itself causes more stress on the body . Fats are also involved in the development of plaques in the blood vessels . See , your body uses molecules called VLDL molecules to transport fats from your fat cells to your muscle . Cholesterol is packaged into the mix because it likes to come for the ride . This in itself is normal for your body , but when your blood starts to have too many of these molecules , chances are some of them are going to be damaged - kind of like in traffic you 're always going to have car accidents . Well , this is n't good for your body so your immune system ( like the police ) like to clear up the mess . They 'll come in and swallow up these VLDL molecules . This is also a normal function of your body , but if there are too much of these happening , the immune cells start to get messed up and foam . These are called foam cells , and they start attaching to the wall of your blood vessels . This causes your blood vessels to harden and that increases your blood pressure and makes you more likely to undergo an accident ."],"8452":["Actually I did a little light research into this a while back . I suffered from very serious basal migraines for a while that have ( luckily ) gone away . There are currently two competing theories as to what causes migraines and causes the resulting pain . Some people claim they are vascular ( caused by a change in blood vessels ) while some say they are related to the nervous system . The vascular claim is , the blood vessels are contracting as a result of a stressor or trigger . A stimulus affects an area of the body consistently causing the blood vessels to constrict . This can cause a loss of oxygen to the area . In my case , parts of the brain were not getting blood and cells were essentially \" drowning \" from a lack of oxygen . Very similar to a stroke . The nervous system based claim I believe says that the nerves themselves are being overstimulated and producing pain signals . I believe this is more likely to be a reason in certain types of migraines ( I wan tot say that abdominal migraines were a type that was based on neurological influence ) . Needless to say , it could very well be a combination of the two and the cause will vary on the type of migraine one experiences . One of the most notable things about migraines is that the term has been used to cover a large variety of symptoms and ailments . Thinking of a migraine as a headache might be a result of pharmaceutical marketing in the US . Source : URL_0","To add onto what has been said before ... 2 theories exist .. the Vascular Theory ( Wolff 's Theory ) and the Central Sensitization Theory . 1 ) Vascular Theory ( largely discredited - unfortunately since it makes more common sense ) A wave of constriction of the small blood vessels of the brain occurs over a period of minutes ( causing the initial \" aura \" and the common neurological symptoms of the migraine . This would explain why migraines can seem stroke - like with focal numbness , weakness , vertigo , visual loss , etc . Then a wave of dilation of those same vessels occurs causing the headache . Unfortunately current research has pretty much discredited it at this point . 2 ) Central Sensitization Theory ( much more complex and less straight forward - which is a shame since its probably the correct one ) A wave of electrical activity passes from the surface of the brain of the brain over a period of minutes ( again causing the aura symptoms ) and when it hits an area in the brainstem called the \" central migraine generator(CMG ) \" ( fancier names exist for the exact nuclei , but ... unnecessary ) . When it activates the migraine sets in . This is why meds like triptans work best when taken early . Migraines are easier to stop before the CMG activates . When it activates a signal is sent which causes the release of inflammatory chemicals and blood vessel dilating chemicals . When the blood vessels dilate ( in the setting of those inflammatory chemicals ) the trigeminal nerve activates causing the perception of facial \/ head pain . The trigeminal nerve is the sensory nerve of the face . There 's a bit about serotonin receptor deficiency as well but the whole things complicated enough already . As for botox , there 's a component of tension headache in the pain from migraines as well , since migraines hurt like hell and patients are understandably tense .

You can convert that data into sound waves ; its analogus to displaying the data on a graph , it 's just another way of looking at it , but doing so is n't much more than a novelty for a press release .","Since you 're referring to the Voyager Plasma Wave experiment I 'll explain about that . But first we have to make a small detour into how a microphone here on earth works : When you listen to a recording of sound that 's been created using some electronic process , something did capture an electrical signal . That something is a microphone . In a microphone you have a thin sheet of material that gets moved by waves of sound pressure , called the diaphragm . Attached to that diaphragm is either a magnet or some electrically charged foil . Either way , the movement of the magnet or the electrically charged foil creates a changing electromagnetic field , which can be picked up by a kind of antenna ( a magnetic coil , or a capacitor 's plate , which are in fact antennas ) . After amplifying the signal it can be recorded and\/or transmitted . Say you had a really , really sensitive radio and a very good antenna , then you could pick up the signal from a microphone that 's not even plugged into anything and that has no electronics whatsoever built in at all . Now what the Voyager Plasma Experiment does is , it replaces the electrically charged diaphragm in a microphone with electrically charged gas (= plasma ) . Even if space is mostly empty , on large scales there 's still quite an amount of mass , which effectively is a very low density gas . And like in every gas there can be sound waves . The pressure is far to small to be detected by a classical microphone . But you can detect the vibrations (= sound ) in charged gas , by detecting the changes in the electrical field the gas itself creates , which is effectively radio and Voyager a radio sensitive enough to pick up the signal from the microphone without a \" wired \" connection . So the plasma itself is the microphone , from which Voyager \" just \" picks up the signal from . I think that this is really cool .","As far as this shows , it does n't .

So if we think of a normal X , Y , dimension plane , and we 're in a race car . If we move in a diagonal direction , we are moving in both the X and Y dimensions . If we move directly in the X direction , then there is no motion in the Y direction . Now , relativity says that time is simply additional dimension to space . So if we are not moving at all , then we are exclusively moving through time ( think only moving on the X axis as above ) . But once we start moving through space , it takes away from our motion through time . At slow speeds of movement through space , it 's kind of like diagonally moving on the X , Y plane from above . But as we approach the speed of light , we are moving so fast through one dimension ( space ) , that we are almost not moving through the time dimension at all .

If you understand the Doppler effect and the very basics of relativity , you should be able to follow what 's going on . This is only meant to explain how such a result is possible , not necessarily why . Lets send a twin out on the spaceship . From Earth , we will send out one ' beep ' signal to the ship every hour ( in Earth time ) . The spaceship will send out a ' boop ' signal to Earth every hour ( in ship time ) . The trip is planned so that the spaceship will travel for 72 hours ship time away from Earth , then turn around and travel back to Earth at the same speed . In other words , 72 boops will be sent while traveling away from Earth , and 72 boops will be sent while traveling to Earth . * * Ship :* * At hour 0 , the spaceship launches moving directly away from Earth . It is going fast enough so that it receives one beep from Earth every * three * hours ( thanks to the relative Doppler effect ) . The spaceship continues to travel until 72 ship hours have passed . In that time , it receives 24 beep signals from Earth , and sent out 72 boops . In other words , it appears that Earth has aged 3 times slower up until this point . * * Earth :* * Earth of course is busy receiving signals too . Since speed is relative , Earth was moving away from the ship at the same speed that the ship was moving away from Earth . So Earth is also receiving one boop signal every three hours . Earth patiently waits for 72nd boop , the indication that the ship has reached the midpoint of the trip . Since it receives one boop every 3 hours this means 9 days passed on Earth when the ship has reached the midpoint . 216 beeps have been sent . And of course , it seems that the ship has aged only 3 days , and is aging 3 times slower . So now , we 're at the half - way point of the trip . The ship sent out 72 boops , and it received 24 beep signals . Earth sent 216 beeps , and received 72 boop signals . In other words , the ship experienced 3 days , and 1 day appears to have passed for Earth , while Earth experienced 9 days , and 3 days appear to have passed for the ship . * * Ship :* * Time to complete the trip . The ship reverses direction after it sends boop # 72 , and heads back to Earth . It continues sending one boop every hour , and since we are now heading * towards * earth , we receive three beeps per hour . The trip takes 72 hours . We send out 72 boops , and receive 216 beeps during that time . * * Earth :* * Earth is now observing the ship 's trip back . Since the ship is moving closer to earth , we are now receiving 3 boops every hour . When the 72nd boop from the return trip is received , the ship lands . In that time , we have sent out 24 beeps . Summary of the second half of the trip : The ship sent out 72 boops , and received 216 beeps . Earth sent out 24 beeps , and received 72 boops . In other words , the ship experienced 3 days and 9 days appear to have passed for Earth . The Earth experienced 1 day and 3 days appear to have passed for the ship . So ... what is the summary of the whole trip ? The ship experienced 6 days . For the first 3 days , it appeared that Earth aged only 1 day . For the second 3 days , it appeared that Earth aged 9 days . Earth experienced 10 days . For the first 9 days , it appeared that the ship aged 3 days . For the last day , it appeared that the ship aged 3 days . # # Earth has aged 4 years more than the ship ! What about a slightly different scenario ? Instead of having the ship turn around after 72 hours , lets have it sit in place and bring the Earth to it ! Earth will begin its journey towards the ship when it receives the 72nd boop . The first half the the trip is the same for both the ship and the Earth . ( Ship experiences 3 days ( 72 boops sent ) , Earth experiences 9 days ( 216 beeps sent ) ) * * Earth :* * The Earth starts moving toward the ship when it receives the 72nd boop at the same speed that the Ship was moving . Earth is receiving 3 boops an hour , it takes 72 Earth hours to reach the ship . Earth receives 216 boops in that time . * * Ship :* * The ship has stopped , but it continues to send boops . It has only received 24 beeps so far . But now , as far as the ship is concerned the Earth is not moving ! The earth is n't expected to begin moving until the 216th beep is received . So the ship waits for the remaining 192 beeps , which takes 8 days . Since we are n't moving relative to each other , we also send 192 boops . * * Ship :* * Finally , when the 216th beep is received , it sees that Earth has begun moving . It receives 3 beeps an hour ... and once 72 beeps have been received , Earth reunites with the ship . It appears that it only took 24 hours for Earth to reach us , and we sent 24 boops . Summary of the trip : From the ship 's perspective , it travels for 3 days then stops . Earth sits still for 8 days ( relative to us ) . Earth then moves toward the ship and reaches it , which takes 1 day . A total of 12 days elapsed . According to Earth , it waited 9 days for the 72nd boop . It then traveled to the ship , which took 3 days . A total of 12 days have elapsed . # # Both the Earth and the ship have aged the same amount ! So what 's going on ? The reason this happens is because the Earth and the ship are going through different accelerations . In the first scenario , the ship accelerates to move away from the Earth , and then it accelerates to move back , while the Earth was stationary . In the second scenario , the ship accelerates to move away from Earth , and then it stops . The Earth later accelerates the exact same way the ship did , and the result is that there 's no time difference between them at the end !

The weird place it leads you is that it means time passes differently depending on how you 're moving . [ The math behind this is n't too difficult to follow ] ( URL_0 ) basically depending on how you and I and moving we can see the light needing to take paths of different lengths , so we perceive time going at different speed . The next step is to see if the weird conclusion is right . We do this my making observations or doing tests . In the case of relativity , it agrees with what we see . Based on this we 've decided that the model reflects reality and we decide it 's right ( or at least for fast moving objects it 's more right than the model we had before ) . I 'm not sure if that helps you wrap your head around it , but sadly reality does n't care if something makes sense to us or not . The twin paradox itself is just a small twist on this that explains why it 's the twin who experiences the acceleration and deceleration that ages less than the one who stays at home .

This is most obvious with photons , they can be treated as small particles when they have high energy ( like x rays ) or like long waves when they have low energy ( like radio waves ) . However nothing fundamental changes about the photon , it 's neither a particle nor a wave ( it 's probably something else we do n't understand ... yet ) . Anyways matter ( atoms ) does the same thing , only it 's a lot more \" heavy \" so most of the time we treat it as a particle and not as a wave . This is where things get interesting : when you cool down matter ( take away energy ) , just like a photon when it has less energy , it spreads out . If you get a bunch of atoms and you make them all really cold , their wave functions overlap , which means that they are indistinguishable from one another , and presto , Bose Einstein Condensate ( BEC ) . You can think about it as if millions of atoms ( most BECs have around 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 7 atoms in them ) are all behaving as if they were one giant atom . Most BECs to date have been made with Alkali and Alkaline Earth elements because we can control them with lasers relatively easily . Not terribly LY5 but hope that helps a little . Making a BEC is a complicated process typically involving laser cooling , atomic traps , and radio frequency evaporation , but that 's for another post maybe . What you do with a BEC varies greatly and I can elaborate on that if people want . Source : 2nd year PhD student working in a lab that makes BECs","All particles have a property called * spin * . It can either come in whole integers ( 0 , 1 , 2 ... ) , or half - integers ( 1\/2 , 3\/2 ... ) . Particles with whole - integer spin are called * bosons * and follow rules called Bose - Einstein statistics . Particles with half - integer spin are called * fermions * and follow Fermi - Dirac statistics . Particles can be in different energy states , and we can think of these as discrete \" energy levels \" . Naturally , there must be a lowest level , which we call the * ground state * . The difference in these two statistics boils down to this : * no two fermions may exist in the same quantum state * . That means that if you have two fermions with the same energy and spin , they can not exist in the same energy level . This rule is called the * Pauli Exclusion Principle * . Bosons , however , do not follow the exclusion principle . So if one were to cool down a large number of bosons , there is nothing stopping them all going into the ground state . This is known as \" Bose - Einstein condensation \" , as they are all condensing into a single quantum state . To get to this state is obviously difficult , as it requires very sophisticated cooling methods , but is very much doable .

PDFs are often smaller than an equivalent image file , because although they look like images , they 're not . Open [ a typical PDF file ] ( URL_1 ) for example . Zoom in several times and you 'll see that unlike an image , it does n't become pixellated . That 's because it uses something called * vector graphics * . You know that computer screens [ are made up of pixels ] ( URL_0 ) and most image formats are the same . If you zoom in enough you 'll see the pixels . Suppose you wanted to store an image of a triangle . If zero is black and one is white , it might look like this : 000000000 000010000 000111000 001111100 That means that you need to store a value for every pixel in the grid . The bigger the image , the more pixels , and the larger the file . But remember that if you want to draw a triangle , all you really need is three sets of coordinates . So you could alternatively represent it as : ( 5 , 2 ) ( 3 , 4 ) ( 8 , 4 ) No matter how \" big \" the image , the same amount of data is needed to represent the triangle . And you can zoom in as far as you want without it becoming pixellated . A triangle is a simplistic example of course . PDFs are actually very complicated , and can store text , images themselves and many other things .","They are n't automatically small . And they do n't do anything particularly magic with compression , if they have images in and are small that s just because the images are themselves small . Text itself is generally very small compared to images , it simply does n't take much space to encode . > What about securitiy ? Are PDFs connected with Flash ? ( just read something abount flash ) The PDF standard is massive and allows for many things , including flash embedded in documents . Adobe reader will let you get away with even more non - standard things . There are various security options , but the documents can contain viruses and there have been ( and are ) security holes in pdf readers like adobe reader itself .","Alrighty , forget everything you already know about computers , because it 's probably wrong anyway . So , a PDF is a computer file similar to a doc file that Microsoft Word might save or a text file that Notepad might save ( although it 's capable of saving much , much more than a simple text file ) . Anyway , when we all come down to it , everything is just patterns of 1s and 0s . We call this \" binary \" ( \" bi \" means two ) . Anyway , all this little computer text represents the text that makes up our document and images . It tells the computer what size the margins are , what colour the font is , the positioning of this and that and so on . Pretty much every little detail that makes up the document . But where does size come in ? Well , the thing about all this binary is that if we break it up , we start seeing patterns . This is where compression comes in . While the exact working is rather complex , an algorithm ( code that takes an input and creates an output ) analyzes these patterns and finds places that can be simplified and grouped together . This makes the filesize much smaller . Another main factor that reduces the filesize is that images are often shrunk . An image that is 5 megapixels in resolution , but only three inches wide in your document is much bigger than needed , so we can shrink down that image into a smaller resolution , which reduces the filesize needed to store everything about that image . So that 's how the filesize gets so small . Now what about security ? First of all , flash is NOT a part of PDFs . There 's no reason to put flash in a PDF , as PDFs were originally created for a manner of having format to store documents with consistent formatting ( because if you open a doc file made in Microsoft Word in LibreOffice , the formatting wo n't necessarily be the same ; not to mention the fact that we did n't always have free word processors and so on ) . Even limited to computers , PDFs do n't need more than basic interactivity , usually limited to forms ( so I can type my information directly into a PDF and send that in ) and links ( which make tables of contents much easier to navigate ) . As for security in general , PDFs are very secure . However , the program you 're opening them in is a tossup . In the past , Adobe 's Acrobat Reader has had bugs which allowed a maliciously designed PDF to work its way into the program and do bad things . However , opening that same PDF in , say , Foxxit Reader might not have that exploit . The biggest security risk in PDFs is no different than that of any website : links . Most modern PDF readers now request confirmation when you click on an external link ( meaning it points to a website ) , with the intent to prevent you from going to a potentially bad website when you though you were just clicking on the table of contents ."],"8647":["Medically speaking a seizure is when the electrochemical circuits of your brain misfire this triggers other portions of your brain to have similar things go wrong . The most close association I can give is a computer program which causes the computer to lock up and need to be restarted . Sometimes this can affect breathing or circulation of oxygen to the brain , This can lead to brain damage . Sometimes it 's minimal sometimes it 's quite extensive . Persons who have one seizure are much more likely to have multiples or repeat seizures . There are numerous medications which decrease the likelihood of you having another seizure . Sometimes just like with your computer , only one program needs to be restarted , sometimes seizures can be localized to only a part of the brain . Usually people lose consciousness briefly sometimes people feel sort of a interesting sensation they call an \" aura \" which can signal they are about to have a seizure .

They can be caused by many many things some people are predisposed to having them do to epilepsy which is basically a slight miss wiring of the brain .

If the Antarctic Ice Sheet melted , sea level would rise by about 60 meters ( 200 feet ) .","As one user pointed out , the sea level rise would primarily occur only if Greenland and Antarctica melted . The reason for this is that they are land - based ice sheets . Ice is less dense than water because the water molecules like to form a crystalline structure , similar to salt or sugar . This is why ice floats in water ( something you can verify at home ) . One user recommended filling a glass with ice , topping it off with water , and letting the ice melt . The ice here represents sea - based ice , such as icebergs and the Arctic . After the ice here melts , you 'll find that the water level has dropped , because the water molecules are n't rigid , and are free to fill their container . To simulate land - based ice ( Greenland and Antarctica ) , imagine you have a rim around the cup from the previous experiment . With the glass full of ice and water , place ice on that rim , so that any water that melts can only drain into the cup . You 'll find that , after all the ice has melted , the water level is higher than at the end of the first experiment , although not necessarily more than at the start of the test . The ice that is on Greenland and Antarctica are n't contributing to the current height of sea level , just like the ice on the rim of the cup . Should they melt , however , their water now becomes a part of the sea . tl;dr : Antarctica and Greenland are land - based ice .","Based on the answers here , if water icebergs melting causes water levels to drop , but land based ice melting increases it , could there not be some sort of balance if both melt at the same rate ?"],"15069":["It is not about any piece of evidence , it is faulty critical thinking skills common to many conspiracy theories .

Otherwise , you 're running on the alternator . The clock in your radio takes only a few microvolts to power , and a lead acid battery would probably decay from chemical reactions and oxidation on its own before wearing out from drain . The radio , lights , and other electronics are a heavy load if you 're using them with the car off , but even then , it could take hours to drain a battery dead . Most people do n't do that . The most load a battery gets is to start the engine , which takes seconds , and then it gets charged in a couple minutes of the engine running . If a car dies in the street and the battery is dead , that 's an indication that there is a problem with the alternator , as it 's not producing power to keep the car running and the battery was drained for that purpose instead .

The more dilute the medicine , the stronger it works . Principle 1 goes like this . If substance S causes symptoms X , Y and Z , then substance S should be used to treat a disease with symptoms X , Y and Z. For example , if you ca n't get to sleep , and go get a homeopathic sleep aid , it 's quite likely that the active ingredient listed on the box will be caffeine . Principle 2 says that once you have identified the active ingredient you want ( e.g. , caffeine for sleeping pills ) , in order to make its effects more pronounced , you should dilute it . When diluting the active ingredient , you 're supposed to dilute it by ten times . That is , you put one part of the active ingredient in ten parts water and mix . Each dilution is one \" x \" . If you look a the label of a homeopathic remedy it 's not uncommon to see 20x or even 60x dilutions . Now , remember , each dilution dilutes the substance by ten times . A 20x dilution is not 1\/20th as dilute as normal , it is 1\/100000000000000000000th ( that 's 1\/10 ^ 20 ) as dilute as normal . Once you get in the neighborhood of 20x dilutions there 's a good chance there is absolutely none of the active ingredient left , and all you have is water . Go higher than that and it 's almost certain there is none of the active ingredient present . Here 's the best bit , though . At the time homeopathy was created , it was relatively beneficial . The important word there is \" relatively . \" At that time doctors were still performing bleedings and giving patients remedies containing heavy metals like mercury . The homeopaths were actually safer , but only because they were n't actively poisoning and harming their patients .

It was discovered these loans were owned by a lot of different companies . Quick investors sold their shares(stock ) in those companies because they ( reasonably ) expected the share price to drop . The selling of stock in those companies caused the share price to drop quickly . Less quick investors learned of this information and decided they wanted to try to limit their losses so they sold their shares too . Eventually with everyone selling shares , few were buying , which made the price drop dramatically . With easy access to information and real * * huge * * issues ( like widespread billions in bad loans ) it 's very easy for a stock to crash . Since companies are so interlinked this often brings down other companies as well . Eventually this might lead to companies unable to attract investors needing to lay of workers . These workers who are now unemployed purchase fewer products from other companies . Since those other companies are now making less money they also start layoffs . Finally people unable to afford their mortgages start getting foreclosed on , dropping the value of real estate all around them , which up until recently was the basis for a huge amount of the wealth in this country . Lower property values , lower demand for their products , few investors and low stock prices cause issues for everyone . Let me know if you need more explained .","Really , when people realize something , is worth less than what everyone is paying for it . The problem compounds when people start taking out loans to pay that higher amount . This happened in 1929 with the stock market , people bought stocks , and went into debt buying stock , hoping they would increase in price . Right around this time , there was an [ act ] ( URL_0 ) that was being debated in congress , if it was passed , some people would lose money . Those people sold their shares . This caused a domino effect where some more people sold their shares out of fear as well . This led to stock price falling , and more people selling before they owed more to the bank than the stock was worth . So on and so forth , the stock was worth nothing and all people had was a mound of debt . This also happened during the dotcom bubble . Companies were seeing their stock shoot up , just because they changed their name , not because they were doing better . This caused everyone to get on the bandwagon , but the bandwagon did n't have enough room , and a lot of companies massively downsized or went bankrupt . Again this happened with the housing bubble in 2008 . Banks lent money to people who could n't afford to get the loans , and the people getting loans were willing to take the risk that the houses would grow in value so that even though they were going into a lot of debt for it , it 'll be ok in a few years . The houses did n't grow in value like expected , and actually fell in value , and people owed more than their house was worth . The banks lost a lot of money this way , because they were stuck with a house worth less than what they lent out . This led to a domino effect , because this was A LOT of money they lost .","First you have to understand what value means . Lets use pokemon cards ( maybe to early for a 5 year old , and maybe its something else that is popular nowadays but you know what I mean ) . I personally do n't like psyduck ( anoying pokemon ) , but I like charizard ( bad ass pokemon ) . That means that I would give more to have a charizard card , compared with the psyduck card . If I had a psyduck card , I would gladly trade it away for a charizard . That is value in a nutshell . Now that you know that value is simply what we would like to give in order to have it , we can talk about a financial crash . First of all , financial crashes are all very different , and are caused differently . While a crash may seem sudden and unexpected it has nothing to do with coincidence . But to understand crashes we must understand a little bit about trading with values , and when and why people can lose when trading with values . People with a lot of values may realize that they have under-\/overestimated the value of the values they have . Of course this happens all the time , and that 's why people make and lose money on a stock market . For example : If you traded your rare charizard pokemon card for a togepi card because you thought a cute pokemon would be popular , but later ca n't find anyone who would like to trade you a pokemon card you find as rare as charizard , your pokemon card collection has lost value . But unlike pokemon cards , which value depend on how much they are printed , the value of things in the real world depend on other things . For example the amount of money ( which is just a kind of value ) your parents paid for your pokemon cards depends on how much the store think they can ask for it to make the most money . If they ask to much not enough will buy , even though those who do pay a lot , and if you ask to little a lot will buy , but they do n't pay enough so it is worth it . How much can you ask for pokemon cards ? Depends on how much you like them , but also how much money your parents have . The amount of money your parents have depends on what their employer think their work is worth . The value of their work depends on what people think the value of what they produce is worth . You can tie everything together this way , so in a ( almost Buddhist ) sense , everything is connected . So if your parents company went bankrupt , your parents would lose their job , they ca n't afford new pokemon cards , and you ca n't get anymore . See how things affect each other ? That 's what happens in a real world crash . Something happens that affect the value of a lot of things which in turn affect the value of other things . In the end most things on the market would be affected , and people would think the value of most things has fallen i.e. a financial crash . But value is relative , and if you think the crash was a misunderstanding and that most things is n't worth less , and that people soon will realize this , you are welcome to invest , but you might be wrong ."],"733":["For a lot of Cuban Americans , this would legitimize the leadership in Cuba and would downplay all the struggles they and their families have gone through .","Yea , it 's like many people have said already .

Imagine a room with plenty of O2 but you 're holding your breath . This is a situation where breathing more is absolutely the right thing to do . There exists a point between these scenarios where the level of O2 is low enough that it ca n't be overcome by breathing more . Hyperventilation is also a thing that would further limit your ability to get more oxygen simply by breathing more .","Basically you can , except that your lungs normally regulate your breathing by CO2 concentration and breathing normally at altitude will get rid of the excess CO2 so your body thinks it has done enough breathing , but you will be short of oxygen - URL_0","Up to a certain point breathing more is sufficient , and it 's a natural physiological response . When the body detects lowered oxygen levels in the blood it increases the breathing rate and the heart begins beating faster . This has the effect of lowering the CO2 levels in the blood , which in turn increases the PH of the blood . Your body can only breathe so much more without causing problems . If you spend some time , roughly four days on average but potentially weeks , at a given altitude your body starts to compensate by excreting bicarbonate , lowering PH levels , along with various other mechanisms such as red blood cell count increasing to a new set point . However you 'll eventually reach an altitude where these compensation mechanisms are insufficient to maintain homeostasis even with time spent trying to acclimate . That altitude varies from person to person .

Basically the only advantage is that browsers support the format natively without loading plugins . Actual videos compressed with video encoders are way more efficient . --- In an animated GIF , each frame of the animation is encoded as a separate file , and then the files are more or less just stuck together in the final animation . You can do something similar with JPEG ( Motion JPEG ) , although it 's not supported by browsers in quite the same way as GIFs . Also GIFs do a better job of compressing line art rather than photographs . Thus , making a video out of GIF images yields pretty poor compression anyhow . In an encoded video file , the video compressor takes into account that successive frames are ( probably ) related to each other . The first frame is encoded completely , in a similar ( but more advanced ) method as a JPEG might be . However , the next frame is typically encoded as just the difference from the first frame to the second . This is way more efficient for most videos where motion happens slowly . Say the video is of a ball falling . In an animated GIF , each frame is a standalone , complete picture of the ball and any surroundings . It 's compressed rather poorly , and a lot of redundant information is sent , so each individual frame is very large . In a video encoded with a video codec ( MPEG1 , MPEG2 , MPEG4 , h.264 , h,265 , etc ) , the first frame is compressed somewhat similarly to a JPEG . Then the second frame basically says \" see the region of the first frame where the ball is ? Move that down a bit . Fill in the background with this information . \" - This frame is * way * smaller and easier to transmit than the first frame . It 's also easier and faster to decode . There are some drawbacks to the video compression approach , but in general it does a way better job of representing the video data with way fewer bits . --- EDIT : Wow , this is getting a lot of attention :) I left out a lot of stuff to keep the answer simple , but I 'm getting pinged about a lot of the same things over and over , so here 's a few quick additions : - Yes , compression algorithm differences matter as well . I said something to this effect , but to extend : GIF uses a compression method that works well for color patterns , and video encoders use something that works better for photographs \/ live video . I did n't try to explain DCT \/ Quantization \/ entropy coding since that 's a super technical topic for ELI5 . - Yes , GIF can represent a simple delta between two frames . However , in the case of video data , it is rare that this is useful . Someone asked for a more detailed explanation of this , [ my response is here ] ( URL_1 ) . - Yes , there may be other factors at work besides the bitrate \/ coding issues . I think it is safe to say that GIF is a terrible video compression format , and that 's probably the root of many other issues . However , I have n't profiled browsers to see where they spend time decoding animated GIFs . I made a list of other places that could be inefficient [ here ] ( URL_0 ) . - Yeah , your \" five year old did n't understand this \" el - oh - el :P If my 7 - yr - old had the interest I 'd try to explain it to him and get his feedback , but I think he 'd rather play LEGO . --- EDIT 2 : A couple more things people are asking \/ mentioning : - Several people have mentioned HTML5 Video and WebM as alternatives to animated GIFs . There 's a lot of back - and - forth , legal issues , competitors refusing to agree and so forth that is really hampering the HTML5 video tag . [ Wikipedia has a long article on the subject . ] ( URL_2 ) We 've had better video technology than GIF for years and GIF is still going strong . I think we 're stuck with it , despite it being a terrible technology for the problem . ( See also : practically every other technology used on the web ) - A common question is \" So does this mean that simpler videos with less movement will be encoded to smaller file sizes ? Or that complex or really random videos make larger or less efficient video files ? \" The answer to this somewhat depends on the encoder settings , but in general the answer is yes . If you encode a simple video with little motion it will take less data than a more complex video with a lot of motion and random stuff going on . Modern video encoders are tuned towards encoding video sequences from cameras . They make assumptions based on what the real world looks like most of the time , and use those assumptions to compress more efficiently . They also take into account what our eyes are good at seeing .","Short answer : videos use better compression techniques than GIFs . GIF was originally designed as a still image format , with the animation capability kind of shoehorned in later . Video uses compression techniques that were designed specifically for video . This means the file size of a GIF is much bigger than an equivalent video ( often 5x to 10x bigger ) , so it takes much longer to download . Long answer : Think of a GIF like a flipbook . It 's a series of still pictures that when played quickly , look like a video . You need to download each one of those still pictures . Each frame is compressed , but little is done to take advantage of the fact that one frame is probably very similar to the next frame ( there are some minor optimizations done though -- for instance if the background of a frame does n't change at all from one frame to the next , that background wo n't be sent to you every time ) . Video uses much better compression techniques . Each frame is compressed like in a GIF , but frames are also compared to the one before and the one after . Just like in a GIF , if the background does n't change it wo n't be sent to you every time . But there are also more clever things that can be done -- say a car is moving from left to right in your video . Video compressors will basically say \" hey that car that was over there in the last frame , just move it to the right 5 pixels \" . So you take the image of the car you already have , shift it to the right , and that 's your next frame . GIF ca n't do this . Since a lot of video consists of smooth motion similar to this , videos compress very well . This is called [ motion compensation ] ( URL_0 ) . There are a number of other issues at play here too : * The compression technology used by GIF is far older than modern video compression , so that the compression achieved by each individual frame is better with modern videos . The LZW compression technique used in GIF is 30 + years old , for instance . * GIF uses lossless compression , whereas most videos use [ lossy compression ] ( URL_1 ) -- basically the video compressor throws away data that you 're probably not going to notice anyway . And even if you do notice it , chances are it 's still good enough to get the point across . ( JPEG is another example of a lossy compression scheme that you 're probably familiar with . ) * Along with this , video compressors throw away some color information as well . This one is harder to explain easily , but basically your eye is better at noticing changes in brightness rather than changes in color . So the compressor looks at the brightness and color of every pixel . When it comes time to write out the video , it stores the brightness for every pixel , but only stores the color for every 4th pixel . The other 3 pixels share that same color . Hopefully that made some amount of sense . It 's called [ Chroma subsampling ] ( URL_2 ) if you 'd like to read more . All that adds up to better compression for video , which means smaller file sizes , which means faster downloads .

A citizen 's arrest is when a regular person ( who is n't a police officer of any kind ) arrests someone who has committed a crime . In the US the rules vary slightly from State to State , but in general anyone can arrest a person they see commit a felony . They then have to hand them over to the police promptly . The difference between this and a police arresting you is that the police can arrest you for crimes someone else saw and then tells the police about , where a citizen can only arrest you for something they see happen . It works the same way a regular arrest would , it could be the citizen simply saying , your under arrest and then waiting for the cops to come , up to full on handcuffing and the whole 9 yards . In some states , if you citizens arrest someone , and you were n't legally justified you might face civil lawsuit for doing so . URL_1 URL_0","Ok , this is n't easy to answer , because we have many states in our country , and they all have laws that can be slightly different . So the answer is going to have to be general , and you 're going to have to realize that in one place it may be different than another . The way a citizens arrest works is that you , as a good person , see someone else being bad . So you tell them \" You are under arrest ! ! \" in your best big - boy voice , and then you call 9 - 1 - 1 and the police come to take them away . Now there are a few things to have to do to make sure you do this right . First off , you have to SEE the person do the bad thing . You ca n't be told by someone else and then go grab the person . This is called \" Witnessing the crime . \" Second , the bad thing they do has to be what 's called a \" felony . \" Now , there are two types of crimes in our county , Misdemeanors and Felonies . Misdemeanors are the little crimes , like slapping someone or stealing candy from a store . Felonies are the big crimes , like really hurting someone on purpose , or robbing a bank . So if you see someone doing something wrong , you need to think , \" Is this a big bad , or a small bad ? \" If it 's a small bad , you need to call 9 - 1 - 1 and let the police handle it . If it 's a big bad , though , and if you do n't stop the person RIGHT NOW someone can get hurt , then you can step in and arrest them . Now there are certain things you need to do once you 've arrested them . First off is make sure that when you are talking to 9 - 1 - 1 ( you already called them , remember ? ) you tell them what you have done . This lets the police officers know that they have to get there faster , because arresting someone when you are n't a police officer can be dangerous . Secondly , you ca n't beat the person up . They may have done a really , REALLY big bad , like hurt a little kid or even killed someone , and you are going to be very , very angry . But like Mr Rogers says , \" Being mad is ok , but you ca n't hurt people because you are mad . \" Now , you can \" defend \" yourself if the person tries to hurt you . That means you can fight BACK , but you ca n't start the fight . But above all , if you see someone doing something bad , call the police . They are the ones who go to school to be police officers , and they have all the tools there on their belt , and they know all sorts of things about laws and dealing with someone who wants to hurt you or other people .

Some techniques can repair missing or damaged data , others can simply detect it . however , you asked about repairing . Let us look at a simple example , with two bytes of data : A : 10010110 B : 11001100 To help with repairing data , we compute the XOR ( exclusive OR ) of the bytes . If both bits are the same , we produce a zero . If exactly one bit is one , we produce a one : A : 10010110 B : 11001100 ----------- C : 01011010 We then inject that extra XOR byte into the data stream , inflating its size by 50 % . Every third byte is a \" parity \" byte that does not directly store data , it is derived from the previous two bytes . Now , when reading the stream of byte , let us assume that one of the bytes is unreadable . Perhaps there is physical damage to the disk . Perhaps the memory buffer is corrupt . Perhaps data was garbled when transmitted over a network . Regardless of the reason , one of the byte is unreadable . If the parity byte is bad , we simply discard it . However , if either of the two data bytes are bad , we can derive them from the other data byte and the parity byte using a property of exclusive - OR : if ` A^B = C ` , then ` A = B^C ` and ` B = A^C ` . A : 10010110 C : 01011010 ----------- B : 11001100 B : 11001100 C : 01011010 ----------- A : 10010110 As you can see , we easily recreated bytes A and B from the other two . If too many bytes are missing , we will be unable to reproduce the missing data . If data is unreadable , but some other data used to recreate it is present but incorrect , then the recreated data will also be incorrect . It may be desirable to combine data parity with a checksum such as [ CRC ] ( URL_2 ) to detect the case where data is present but incorrect . Note : \" parity \" is often used to refer to a [ parity bit ] ( URL_0 ) which is a mod-2 count of one bits in a byte , but can be extended to more bits in this way similar to what [ RAID with parity ] ( URL_1 ) does .","Basically it all boils down to adding redundancy , but each technique adds that redundancy in a way to maximize error detection , error repair , or size - bloat . Basically , you can * detect * that there were < N errors using far less extra data ( eg . a 64bit CRC ) than it takes to actually find and correct < N errors in the data . As you increase the amount N of data that you need to correct , the more redundant data you need around to correct with . Besides the other answers , the topic can get very complicated . Tools like [ Reed - Solomon codes ] ( URL_0 ) provide a much more robust correction technique .

He worked hard on his release in preparation for the NFL draft , and has worked during the offseasons to better his throwing motion as well , but he 's still not particularly close to being an NFL caliber thrower . The reads might actually be a worse problem . In a typical high school offense , a quarterback usually has 2 - 3 receivers \/ backs running routes , but knows beforehand which one he 's throwing to . His pre - snap read might alter that , but after the snap of the ball , it 's kind of a one - track mind . In high school , this is n't a big deal , because defenses do n't particularly mix up their schemes . If the backer is showing blitz , he 's most likely blitzing , and you can pretty much spot a 2 deep zone with little to no confusion . It also does n't hurt that most high school defensive coordinators will put in a base defense that will last them the whole season , and maybe make some tweaks , but a 4 - 3 cover 2 will come out in that every . single . down .

At the pro level , though , everyone , even the DEs , are as fast or FASTER than Tebow , and the size \/ strength difference is eliminated if not greatly reduced against the average defender . So just to wrap this up , Tim Tebow is not a viable quarterback ( outside of major changes to his mechanics and reads , or a complete system overhaul to fit HIM specifically ) because he ca n't read a defense , forces the ball into coverage instead of making better decisions , and does n't have much experience of being a throw - first quarterback when he 's up against competition that ca n't be run on ( via qb option sets ) consistently .

If you ever watch college football , you 'll see that there are a ton of running plays , passes are short , and there 's a heavy emphasis on the option play . ( An option is where the QB run to the side . If he thinks he can gain lots of yards , he heads forward . If there 's a defender in his way , he quickly tosses the ball to a teammate behind him . ) Tebow did very well in this style of play . However , in college , talent is spread out among hundreds of teams and players only get 4 years to play . In the NFL , there are only 32 teams with players able to play as long as they can , along with excellent training . What does this mean for an offense ? It means that you have to play every game against essentially an all - star team . Defenders are too fast and good at tackling for you to get by with just QB runs , short passes , and the occassional option . In short , a QB must be a good passer . So , let 's look at Tebow 's NFL passing . I 'm going to focus on his stats in [ 2011 ] ( URL_0 ) , since that 's when he got lots of playing time and he gained a lot of notoriety . In that season , he got to start all the games after the bye week . Look at those 11 weeks . On only 2 occasions did he pass for over 200 yards . If you include rushing yards , he certainly did better , but there was never an instance where his total yards hit 300 . People love to hate Mark Sanchez , but he got 300 passing yards 3 times this year . And Sanchez was n't on as good a team as Tebow when he started . Now that we 've established that Tebow is n't great in terms of yards , what about winning ? Tebow supporters point to the fact that the Broncos won games when Tebow started . That 's true , but it only happened because the team 's defense stepped up their game . An average NFL team scores in the low 20s in an average game . In Tebow 's 11 starts , the Broncos only had 3 games where they scored at least 20 points . Does it take talent to score 17 points in the NFL ? Of course . Does that achievement explain the amount of hype Tebow received ? No . In short , Tebow is n't the worst QB in the world . He could definitely beat me or you in any football - related competition . He just is n't particularly good by any measure when compared against other QBs in the NFL , mainly due to his lack of passing ability . The reason he get insulted so much is that he got so much undeserved attention after a mediocre season ( although the attention probably was n't his fault ) . As a result , he 's earned a reputation as being overrated and is stuck with expectations that he does not appear capable of meeting .","In college , he was an excellent QB in that system with a lot of powerful weapons around him . Harvin , Hernandez , etc . But great college QBs do n't always translate so well into the NFL . First off , his accuracy , especially at mid \/ long range , is pretty pisspoor . He has difficulty hitting the tight windows you need to in the NFL because of superior CB \/ LB \/ safety play . He 's big , but not quite fast enough to be a really outstanding rushing QB . And you mentioned his throwing mechanics , which are still sub - par -- he needs to be able to get the ball out faster . That , and the media shitstorm that follows him wherever he goes .

There is a lot of wrong comments in this thread . Let me give you some clarification . - Whether you Lease or Purchase a vehicle unless you write a check for the car the bank OWNS the car . Not You . - Leasing is another way to finance the vehicle where you are paying a little extra to remove yourself from liability of the cars equity . - You can still negotiate and sell the vehicle at any point while on a lease contract , you do n't just have to turn the vehicle in at the end . If you have equity you can use it as a negotiation tool when you trade for another vehicle . - when you turn a vehicle in it 's the banks vehicle not the dealership , usually the bank will offer it to the dealership first but you can turn it into any dealership any of them can negotiate . This means the dealership does n't necessarily care whether you lease or buy . That being said ... - manufacturers want people leasing because it is more likely you will want a new car In a few years even tho you have the option of buying the vehicle first at the end of your lease and refinancing it . - dealers want you to lease because it is a lot easier for a dealership to add profit places . they can fudge the Cap cost , they can fudge the residual value , this is where it 's an afvantage for a dealer to have you lease . It has to do with the contracts , it 's easier to hide money in a lease contract . TLDR : Just to wrap up because I think I 'm writing a lot . Lease is just another way to finance . Any way you finance you do n't own the car . If you are going to Lease do lots of research go to more places and look closely at your contract . If you have any questions just ask , I love helping people buy cars because after selling them I know there are a lot of ways you do n't know where I can still make money .","The main advantage of leasing to the consumer is you can get a better car for the same monthly payment , at least in the short term . If you want to drive a Mercedes but have a Toyota income , leasing can make that happen . Dealers like it because it helps them sell more expensive cars . They make about the same money whether you buy or lease a $ 20 K car ... but they make more from you leasing a $ 40 K car . That said , leasing is almost always a poor financial choice for the consumer . If you have a Toyota income , you should drive a Toyota and save up until you can afford to buy that Mercedes .","IIT there seems to be an awful lot of assumptions and \" that sounds right \" logic , but no insider knowledge . I used to agree that there leasing was basically for suckers who wanted to own a car beyond their means , but my brother ( who works in a dealership ) convinced me otherwise . Like everything , there is a tradeoff but according to him , leasing is actually kind of win win for both parties . Buying : When you buy a car , it is yours and you do whatever you want with it . Personally , this is a big plus , but financially , maybe not the wisest move . You see , your car loses value as soon as it goes from new to used so one month in , you owe most of the car which has lost a substantial amount of value . With homes , people tend to sell them ( and panic ) but for some reason , they do n't think about it with cars . Leasing : This benefits the dealership because , like some assumed , they still own the car at the end of the day . However , they own a 2 - 5 yr old car which is worth a whole lot less than when you first started using it . The reason dealerships will take this deal anyways is because there is a definite market for used cars and a need to have a used car inventory . Leasing often ties you to the dealership for maintenance , so they have definite records of how good the car is ( important for warranties etc ) . Believe it or not , this actually benefits the consumer many times too . Whether we realize it or not , people who tend to buy a new car , also tend to want an even newer car 5 - 7 years down the road . If they bought , they paid a lot more than a lease , for a car that is worth way less now . For people who buy a car until it breaks down , the old car often further drains you with maintenance after the 100k mark where more expensive parts need to be purchased and cars tend to become unreliable . Things to know : Older cars become less valuable , and more so at high mileage points . For this reason , the dealership puts strict rules and steep fees for driving more than the allotted miles . If you have no choice and KNOW you will use more than the miles provided , my brother recommends you BUY and not lease . However , he does suggest you buy a certified used car as the economic drop of a car going from new to used is simply not worth it . This is obviously , his advice to me as his brother , but often tells this to customers too . However , intangibles like piece of mind do n't have a set value , and many customers decide to buy new anyways . Deals : Some people ITT mentioned about deals . The profit margin for a new car ( lease or sold ) is actually quite small so saying \" give me your best price \" is nt going to work . For this reason , you will rarely find an amazing deal from dealership to dealership as they are all buying from the same company . Essentially , a 2015 Honda Accord will be the same base price in any Honda dealership . The biggest difference is in financing which can vary depending on how big of a risk a dealership wants to take on your creditworthiness ( and this is actually what you probably want to focus on if getting a new car ) . Deals do exist with used cars though . For some reason , many dealerships will sell a used car for a loss if they have had it for too long . It is pretty much just taking up space . Trade ins : We did n't discuss this ( my brother and I ) , but generally , you will get less than your car is worth for a trade in . However , it is usually likely they will take it , so some people are okay with eating the loss . He always sells his own cars to private parties . Loyalty : With this 5 - 7 year new car trend , dealerships rely A LOT on return customers and referrals . While of course , the dealership wants to make as much money as possible , they would also rather sell you two cars than one . For this reason , dealerships generally play it safe across the board and would rather make their money with add ons than with totally ripping you off on the base price of a new car .

When removing something from the disk , like when uninstalling , the computer just needs to remove the record from the index . That will make the disk \" forget \" that the data is there . This takes a lot less time than actually writing the data .","Installing usually involves decompressing the files to be installed ( like unzipping ) . This is why a small download can require much more disk space to install . Decompressing takes time as it uses a lot of CPU power . Deleting is just marking the files as deleted which is super quick . The time is not so much in the reading \/ writing to disk but in the decompressing . Unless your installing from a CD , in which case the read speed from the CD will play a large part in the slower install .","To explain like you 're 5 ... think of it like a desktop ... when you 're setting up things you take your time and make sure it 's all in the right place and neat and accounted for ( uncompressing files , indexing space ) ... but if you are suddenly just going to trash it ... one sweep of the arm will clear it all off again ."],"10236":["A statement like \" better \" needs a rigorous and formal definition , but that 's going to be hard to agree on . It is most likely out of reach of the hard sciences . However , you could set up a study whereby many users are directed to use a search engine to find things on the internet . For the sake of minimizing bias they should not know what the search engine is -- the results from Google , Bing , and any other competitors you want to throw in there should all be displayed in the same format . From there you would have to set up metrics for success -- how quickly were the users able to locate the information they were looking for , for example . You could also include a survey of how the users felt ; in this sort of a blind study you can trust their answers more than a general survey , since the users presumably should n't know whether they were looking at Google results or Bing results . From a more objective standpoint you can look at things like how fast the search completes . If you carried out this sort of a study then you would likely see some sort of a trend arise ( or perhaps no trend at all -- the \" null hypothesis \" has to always be considered ) . It 's doubtful that you would see one search engine standing as the clear victor across all areas and across all demographics . I 'm not aware of anyone who 's actually carried this sort of a study out , but it 's probably been done before .","Yes , there is and I 'll do my best to explain . An internet search is not just a bunch of words that appear in certain pages . The order of words in the search and the context that each word in the search provides for the others can provide a lot of subtle information about the intent of the search beyond the words themselves . Google 's searching procedure employs more powerful models for attempting to pinpoint the actual intent of a user 's search . These models are based on probability and very quantifiable and ultimately result in the deriving of more relevant results in a Google search for a tricky query than those you might get from Bing . Another important aspect of Google 's search procedure is their choice to base the ordering of the results on the authority of the content in each result as opposed to simply looking for the words within the text on each page . \" Authority \" of a page , or how likely the content of the page is to actually be truthful and useful , is again approximated through probabilistic models and many of these models were in - fact invented at Google . Mathematically , Google has always been the leader in finding relevant results , which is really the most important thing when retrieving internet from such a large dataset as the web . EDIT : I did n't really address how one might prove that Google 's results are better than Bing 's . Like I was saying , search relevance is based on different methods of using probability to determine if a result matches what the user wanted to find . A comparison of the algorithms that Google uses vs. those that Bing uses could provide all the information you needed to know to determine if one will be better than the other . If you had the math training you could examine both and you would likely find that Google does more to find the relevant pages than does Bing .","I think it would be a matter of preference based on the user . Some factors of this could include the users comfort with one company over another , the results ( such as images , videos and information they tend to want ) , and the way the search engines work . I ca n't speak much for Bing , but I do know Google has a long listed registry of your search patterns and history . So , they try to adapt to what you tend to seek out . This is accrued through using Googles Gmail and the way certain ads may pop up on the side of your screen that include key - words . Key - words that are used many times will produce different results .

Basically , leasing will allow you to drive a car you would n't otherwise be able to , but you have to give it back after 3 years . If you like the idea of keeping a car for 10 years ( or until it dies ) leasing is n't for you . If you want to drive a new car every 3 years , leasing will ( likely ) be cheaper and easier ( selling a car yourself can be a hassle ) .","If you purchase a vehicle . You can drive it as much as you want , you are responsible for oil changes , repairs , broken things , etc ... It will depreciate over time and what it was once valued at will probably be 1\/3 or 1\/4 of its original price or less .... If you like it and hang on to it ... the financialy gain is great . You can put it on PL \/ PD when its paid off , and pay less insurance , you wo nt have a car payment . It will improve your credit score etc etc .. When you lease a vehicle .. Typically you have to put X amount down ... which is the same for financing , but when you finance it can be from 0 to any number you want , depending on your credit score , if you have a crappy one , you might be forced to put down more ... Anywah when you lease a vehicle you put a fixed number down like 2k oe 3k due at signing ... The benefit is you typically have a lower car payment for the same car ... Lets say you leased a BMW .. Your least would be 200 buck a month ... If i financed the exact same car it owuld be like 400 a month ... so one of the benefits to a lease is a smaller payment .... Another benefits to leases is there s companies that do special leases , like old school muscle cars , exotic cars , so if you re into that there you go ... In general the regular companies is you can leas cars around 4 years old ... That s another benefit , you get to lease newer cars for cheap .. The lease years go from 1 to 3 yrs ... If you have a good rapport the next lease you may not have to put anything down at all ... A lease is good for someone who \" wants \" a new car every few years \" without having to lose alot of money on trade in value and always having to pay huge down payments ... The downside is you can only go set amount of miles .. like 15k if you go over you have to pay more ... If there s damage , like scratches , fading interior , you will have to pay for that stuff ... So i would nt lease if you have kids , families or dirty people .. I would advise having an actual gaarage . A friend of mine had a lease an dhis lease was almost up .. they said the car was in an accident according to carfax an dhe had to pay them 1k before he can sign another lease .. he had to get hold of carfax to dispute , which it worked because he was nt in an accident and they did nt charge him the 1k ... There are also options like lease to own .. so if you lease a car for 4 yrs , at the end of the lease if you wanna pay the difference , the car is yours ... If personally bought 13 cars in 10 years .... I would have heavily benefited from leasing because i like having a new car every year :) so i would have been perfect for a lease but i did nt know . I now lease and nejoy it .. i do nt want to own a car just yet .. i m young and i still have some testosterone in my blood , enough to make stupid decisions ... The financial loss of leasing or owning is relatively the same . The only drawback woul dbe that you do nt actually own a car if you lease and you have to me more careful how you treat the car mechanically an dcosmetically , but do nt have to be concerned with major repairs because it is so new and the payments are cheaper ... If you own you will eventualy have to get repairs on it , but there will be a point when you wo nt have payments anymore and if you take good care of it , it can last you 10 20 years and help clear .. i dunno maybe 1\/4 or more of your budget and allow you to buy a house or vacation or do other stuff ...

This is especially harmful because places where Fracking commonly takes place is lacking water already ( In Texas : Barnett Shale , Eagle Ford Shale are both big ones ) .

Cars are complicated , how well would you know \/ do you trust your mechanic to find in an hour or less a small issue with some system in the car . The prior owner has owned the car for a month , which is more time to better assess the quality of the car than the buyer . Given that difference in information , how large a discount from the new price do you want ? Now we 'll go full Sicilian , if the seller knows you 'll almost certainly want a large discount and is still selling their car after one month , the small problem must be serious enough that he expects to be better off after selling the car . A few rounds of that logic , and sellers of all but the worst cars are willing to reconsider , and buyers expect the shortly after purchase market to only consist of very poor cars . So prices drop like a rock , the instant a new car is taken off the lot . Because that 's a huge loss in value , ( and leasing programs ) manufacturers try to capture some of that value with certified used sales ( where the manufacturer who has considerable knowledge of where problems have occurred can ensure those issues do n't exist on a certified used car ) , but the price is still a good bit lower because the seller always knows more about the car than the buyer .","Value is n't what the seller thinks it should be worth , it 's what a buyer will pay .

The buyer will weigh in his mind , \" Do I want this car , or a perfectly brand new car for only $ 200 more ? ) They will go for the new one almost every time .

I have been in business for along time and am part of a global business leadership program plus studied business at the Univ . of Connecticut . I also worked as a manager in an outsourced contract center in Mexico . In cost accounting we attempt to break down the cost of a product . Take any product , say a lollipop . The are material costs ( the candy , the sticks , the wrapper ) . There are labor costs ( the guys who run the machines that make this , the guys who pack it etc ) . Then there is GSA ( general selling and administrative expenses ) . A business leader seeks to maximize gross profit margin , that is the amount of money applied to the operating income after the costs of goods is subtracted . When the business leader analyses the costs that go into making the lollipop they may find that the labor costs are contributing a disproportionately high percentage . The decision may be made at that point to lower labor costs by sending the labor to an outsourcing center , where the labor cost per unit will be considerably lower . The idea is to increase the gross profit margin . It does not always work but in a labor intensive operation it usually can if managed properly . It is really just a matter of mathematics when it comes to whether or not it is a good deal to do . Now for my personal opinion . In most cases I do not feel that outsourcing hurts America . In many ways the argument can be made that it helps America . The majority of jobs that are sent overseas are non - skilled . This does two things . It keeps consumer prices down , which is good for the economy overall and it forces the American people to seek new and better ways to earn a living . I do not want the next generation to depend on a vocation that can easily be done by unskilled laborers overseas . I would rather they learn a skilled labor vocation . Now people usually automatically react to outsourcing as stealing American jobs . I can say that at one time I was a partner business owner that manufactured a product where the contribution margin was razor thin . We wanted to keep the business in Houston , TX . It was absolutely necessary to keep labor costs low . We posted job positions for line workers and material handlers at the labor cost that would sustain the business and received no responses form \" typical Americans \" . Our only choice was to either move the manufacturing south of the border or not be in business at all . We did not go into business to fail , but to make profit for our stakeholders . We ended up hiring first generation immigrants who were willing to work for the lower wage . Remember that in the labor market workers only have one of two things to offer : a special skill or the willingness to do something that anyone can do for less money .","First off , I think you need to make a distinction between outsourcing and offshoring clear . Outsourcing merely refers to an organisation contracting with a third party to do work for them , with the expectation that the third party will be able to do so more cheaply or efficiently . For instance , I used to work for an insurance company who , as a result of numerous mergers , had many different types of legacy policies that were no longer actively sold , held on many different legacy systems . They were getting rid of older systems where they could to make their IT infrastructure more efficient , but it was a fairly arduous process . So , they contracted with a third party who already had a system that they claimed could quite happily deal with all of the legacy policies satisfactorily to administer them on their behalf . This third party now manages these policies , and all the staff who were working on these policies are now employed by this third party . Offshoring refers to the practice of relocating work from one country to another , usually one where certain costs , such as land or labour , can be had significantly more cheaply , or there are fewer requirements that must be met ( such as labour laws , health and safety provisions and so on ) . While sometimes the company will deal with this themselves , it 's very common to deal with a third party in the country work is being relocated to who will directly employ the new employees , thus making offshoring a type of outsourcing in many cases . The theory behind outsourcing is that by putting the process out to tender , the most efficient partners can be chosen , and a business can concentrate on what it does well . Also , if a third party deals with multiple partners in this way , they can benefit from economies of scale due to the volume of work they do - for instance , it should be more efficient for one company to run 60 different workplace canteens than for 60 different companies to run their own , because a company with 60 different canteens is going to be buying supplies in far higher volumes , and so is more likely to be able to get bulk discounts and negotiate better deals , thus driving costs down . However , in my experience the differences between company cultures and processes can make it very difficult to get anything done when dealing with an aspect of the work that involves the third party - it becomes horribly bureaucratic . With offshoring , I 've found that the differing attitudes and expectations between cultures can be a barrier . Also , customers are n't always entirely happy with dealing with someone in another country ( sometimes because they have trouble dealing with an accent , or they perceive that the company is being a cheapskate and getting cheap but poor quality customer service staff , and occasionally because someone is just plain racist ) . Also , it very often does n't work out anything like as cheap as the offshoring companies like to claim - the labour costs might be reduced , but it will mean training up a lot of new staff - fine for quite basic tasks , but if it 's even slightly complex , then it may well take years before the new employees are up to the standards of their predecessors . In addition , the fairness of offshoring and outsourcing to existing employees is at least somewhat questionable . Also , slightly tongue in cheek here , but an interesting point nonetheless - why should it be the company that outsources the job and pockets the difference ? Why should n't you or I be able to outsource our own jobs ?","EL5 ? Okay , you need to tie your shoe .

The problem is that to make widgets in the United States , where the standard of living is comparatively good , a worker 's wages are protected by unions , Federal laws , and the need for health care . Plus there 's a lot of safety inspection , emissions standards , and so on to drive up the cost of operating the factory . It costs $ 2 to make a widget in the US , which you have to sell at a $ 4 profit to make good money . So you can only sell them at $ 6 or higher . Along comes Elbonian Widget Corp. In the country of Elbonia , they pay their workers a lot less , have no health care to speak of , and their factory conditions are ... let 's say we turn and look at the pretty , pretty Elbonian sky instead . Oh , pretty little fluffy clouds ... but they can make widgets for only a few cents each . They enter the US market , and are selling widgets at $ 3 \/ ea because they are selling them in bulk to Wal - Mart and the insane volume reduces the cost . Holy shit . Your widgets might be better made and support American jobs , but Wal - Mart is selling them to nearly everybody . One of the ways you can reduce cost is have Elbonia make your widgets . They charge you more than a few cents each , but you insist on less flimsy plastic , and have to meet lead and PVC standards , and while the failure per unit is might higher , you compensate by making more ( after all , you do n't have to worry about landfill issues , that 's Elbonia 's problem ) . You have marketing cover the rest , and sell them as iWidgets on a faded white background with some \" underdog - like \" character promoting them . Elbonia does n't care because they are selling even more widgets at even more profit . And you keep flying the Elbonian company president over to drink whiskey and visit Las Vegas . It 's good to be the king . This is great for consumers . And your company . And Elbonia . But it sucks for American blue collar labor . Your factories are closed , people are out of work , and the unskilled labor pool sucks on the teats of unemployment and later welfare . \" They should go to college and get a degree , \" you say from your 80th floor skyscraper . \" That 's what I did . \" They ca n't pay for education , and besides , if everyone had a degree , it would n't really improve things . You need a blue collar labor pool since the dawn of civilization . But there are only so many push broom jobs out there . Americans do not have the population small enough to support internal blue collar infrastructure . Not with a decent standard of living they require . Now even white collar jobs are not safe . I used to work for a company that said this , \" To pay a programmer at a $ 75k salary , it really costs the company almost $ 100k because we have to pay for his health care , desk , chair , office building , cafeteria , lighting , electricity , and so on . But if I get a programmer from Bangalore ? He costs $ 8k \/ year , and India takes care of the rest of the stuff . Hell , we can hire THREE of them to work in different shifts , so we have a 24x7 programmer for only $ 24k . \" You could argue , \" well , they will be shitty programmers , \" but just like selling widgets , you compensate for quality by increasing volume so the bad work thins out . In theory . White collar work as a commodity is not so cut and dry . This had created some really shitty software for a lot of companies , and many are now rethinking this philosophy . Not only that , but a lot of Indian workers got savvy , and started demanding more pay , so they are no longer the cheapest option .

They do n't heal after they are formed because once a tissue can not really change it 's function . Scar tissue does not have the same qualities as skin or muscle or whatever it \" should be \" and it ca n't become something it 's not . Your body is also not really capable of dissolving it later or replacing it , the scar just sits there . It does gain some flexibility over time and tends to change colour but it 's still scar tissue . EDIT : just for reference here 's a better explanation . Your tissues are designed to heal asap . There is no functional benefit to the skin taking it 's time to regrow and reconnect the tissue properly . This is the same basic idea behind blood clotting ; it 's a bad idea to simply wait until the blood vessels heal after they are cut , so rather than make it look pretty , a crappy clot just forms over the wound . With wound healing your body is just trying the patch the tissue ( eg . skin ) as a defence mechanism to protect against infection . A scar is basically just a mass of disorganized tissue held together by a bunch of collagen fibres . It forms quickly and \" good enough \" to cover the wound and hold the tissue together .","You can try cold welding it in a 100 % vacuum ...","Okay I 've never tried this & it 's been a while since my medical devices course but here 's a quick rundown . Basically you have two different mechanisms for healing 1 ) Scar Tissue ( This is what you are referring to ) 2 ) Regeneration ( This is what happens with tinier scars that can undergo mitosis ) Scar tissue basically happens when you damage part of the body that can not undergo mitosis ( mitosis is when your cells multiply , divide , and repeat to replace the damaged area ) and is unable to heal completely . Like if you imagine had a paper cut . It usually replaces itself over the course of a week and you may have some discoloration that will fade with time . Now imagine receiving a deeper cut , like cutting you hand with a knife , or bit by a squirrel ( verified ) . This damages a layer of the skin that was n't designed to regenerate because it can not undergo mitosis . As a result your body has to find a different way to repair the damage . Scar tissue is the bodies way to fix the damage by isolating the damage since the cells around ca n't repair the damaged area . This also means that if the damage is large enough and no cells are close by scar tissue can form . Even if the cells can regenerate . Let me try to think of an analogy Imagine grass right ? Let 's say that something happens and part of the grass ( Cells ) dies . Either 1 ) New grass will take root and start to grow where the old grass ( Mitosis ) was or 2 ) the dirt ( Extra cellular matrix or cells that under go meosis ) that sustains the grass will be washed away . So what grows in its place ? Another type of grass or weed ( This is glue in the wood block ) . TL : DR Body undergoes regeneration and replacement , scar tissue replaces cells that the body ca n't regenerate or grow back fast enough to prevent any further damage to the system .

The system does n't differentiate where the signal is sent , and is broadcast nationally for each alert , but you do n't see the ones that do n't apply to you because of those tones at the beginning of the broadcast . The first time the modem noise is played , the EAS is broadcasting information about the affected area , the type of alert , and the originator to the EAS device located at the station . This code is then repeated two additional times in order to ensure that the data was correctly interpreted on the receiving end . The receiver at the broadcast station reads this data , determines automatically if the alert is valid for the broadcast area , and cuts into whatever is playing in order to relay the information .

Harry is guided to a crossroads where he can choose to become like Voldemort and chase immortality or to choose the wiser path and achieve a meaningful death . The destruction of the other hallows and the acceptance of the third is symbolic of his choice toward the wise path .

So how does it work then ? To help with this lets use the popular game duck hunt as a base . The game is running and you have those ducks flying around the screen . When you pull the trigger the screen becomes completely black and were the ducks are is a white square . This transition happens faster than the human eye can register but it is long enough for the gun . The gun itself works similar to that of a camera . When you pull the trigger it takes in what it sees and if it sees black it tells the game it missed the duck . If it sees white it returns as a hit . This is also the reason why you can cheat with some of these games by just pointing the gun at a white object instead of the screen . EDIT : had the wii set up mixed up . thing on top of TV sends out 2 IR points that the wii - mote reads","Additional to previous answers ( the screen flashing black then making an area around each enemy white , which the ' camera ' in the light gun detects ) , there is also another factor which allows the game to know * which * enemy you hit . Old TVs ( CRTs ) update the screen by scanning a beam horizontally one line at a time , from top to bottom . Any point on the screen is brightest when first hit with the beam , then slowly fades out until it is scanned again the next frame . The console knows which part of the screen is being updated at any given time . When you click the trigger the light gun watches for the point in time that the area it is aimed at gets updated , and the console can then work out where on screen you were aiming . As all modern TV technologies ( LCD , Plasma ) do not scan the screen in the way that old ( CRT ) TVs did , proper light guns do not work on them . Any ' Light Gun ' that works on newer TV types operates in a different way , normally by placing IR lights around the screen that can be tracked , like a Wii - mote . Essentially 1 ) Click trigger 2 ) Camera in zapper watches the screen for the time at which the ( Cathode Ray ) beam in the TV passes the point the zapper is aimed at 3 ) As the console knows what it was drawing at that time , it can determine if you were aimed at a particular enemy , or missed .

In a nutshell , the bank pays for your house , and then you pay the bank back in monthly installments . Once all the payments are made , you own the house . A reverse mortgage is exactly what it sounds like . The bank pays * * you * * in monthly installments , and once they 've paid the cost of the house , they get to keep it . They 're essentially buying the house back from you , a little at a time . This is attractive to retired people who do n't have much savings , and do n't have a pension . They get a steady paycheck from the bank , get to continue living in their house , and , depending on their age , will likely die before the reverse mortgage is fully paid . At that point , the remaining payments go to their estate .","Essentially you sign a contract with a bank . The bank gives you money , and you give the bank the rights to your house when you die .","A reverse mortgage allows seniors to tap into the equity of their homes . It is highly regulated and even more so shortly . As an example , if you are 62 years old , your home is worth 100k and you have no mortgage , you can get about 40 - 50k out . You have s number of options based on the type of RM you get . If you get a fixed rate , you will have to take it out in a lump sum ( though this is a misnomer as the funds are broken up into two payments , one on the closing date and the other 12 months after the closing date ) . If you get an adjustable ( and this is not the same as a traditional adjustable , yet it gets the same negative vibes because it is called adjustable ) . You have three options , a line of credit option ( which grows with home 's value ) , a monthly draw ( kind of like a mortgage payment , but the mortgage payment goes to you - this is for as long as you \/ your spouse live in the home ) , or a lump sum ( again a misnomer as the funds are handed out differently ) The reason the funds are broken out over two payments for lump sum payments is that HUD saw people taking out the reverse mortgage lump sum and then going out and spending it all . They want the reverse mortgage program to be more of a financial tool as opposed to a cash windfall model . When the loan becomes due and payable , the heirs can either sell the home and keep what is remaining after the reverse mortgage is paid for ( and again , you are only getting a % of the home 's equity , so there should be something left over ) , they can refinance the reverse mortgage balance into a traditional home loan and take ownership of the house , or they can simply walk away from the home and let the servicer deal with it . The loan program has been around since the 80 's but only recently has been used int he United States ( really started growing in 2006 ) , but has a really solid foothold in Europe where it is viewed on an equal footing to a standard loan . edited : forgot a closing parenthesis ..."],"6216":["There are lots of objects which reflect in the IR and UV spectra , they just tend to reflect light in other spectra which you CAN see as well . When we say that an object is \" Red \" what we really mean is that it reflects more red light proportionally , not that that particular narrow wavelength is all that 's bouncing back , and everything else is being absorbed . Keep in mind too , an object which only reflected UV or IR would n't necessarily be clear , if it 's ABSORBING the other frequencies it would appear black . If it was passing other frequencies but not passing UV and IR , congratulations , you 've discovered ( some ) glass .","Everything around you ( that 's at room temp - ish ) is glowing in the infrared spectrum . If you have ever seen a piece of matter ( say some metal ) glowing red , and watched it cool down until it stops glowing , it actually has n't stopped producing a glow . It is just that the frequency of the glow it produces has dropped out of the visible spectrum and into infra - red . We need an additional light source to see , so just because something is glowing in infrared , does n't mean visible light does n't bounce off of it back to our eyes . If the object let visible light pass through it perfectly , then yes it may be hard for us to see it , but you could probably see it with an infrared camera . Glass actually blocks certain frequencies of ultraviolet light , even though we do n't think of it as opaque . If you wanted an object to glow in the ultraviolet spectrum , you would have to get it incredibly hot . Hotter than most materials can get without being destroyed . Just as the metal that glows red and cools back to infrared , you would have to continue heating an object to make it glow at frequencies higher than the visible spectrum . Many birds and insects can see in ultra violet .","Infrared and ultraviolet are not colors , they are spectrums of light that encompass a range of frequencies or wavelengths beyond the ability of the human eye to detect .

There are 2 major categories for bobsled brakemen . Strong guys and fast guys . Granted , all of the world class ones are both , but depending on their sports background ( football vs. track for example ) the individual might lean more towards strength over speed and vice versa . # 2 guy ( the one behind the driver on the left ) gets in the sled pretty early . He 's generally on the stronger side vs. speed side since he gets 1 less step to help accelerate the sled . The # 3 guy ( the one on the right ) is most likely the most well rounded of the 3 guys pushing the sled . This is because there is no one pushing the bobsled on that side with him . He 's all by his lonesome pushing on the right side . This means he has to be both fast and strong . Sometimes this guy will push from the side in 4 - man , but from the brakes in 2 - man .

An example in everyday life is the hydraulic brakes on your car vs the air brakes on a big truck . On your car , when you press the brake pedal , hydraulic brake fluid forces the brake pads to push against your rotors or drums and stop the car . If your brake lines fail and the fluid escapes , you can no longer move the pads and you ca n't stop . On a big truck that has air - brakes , the exact opposite is true - air pressure normally holds the brake pads away from the rotors \/ drums , and when a trucker presses his brake pedal , it lets air out of the system and the pads close and stop the truck . If air brakes on a truck fail and the air escapes , the brakes slam shut and the truck ca n't move until the brakes are repaired . By the same token a bomb can be made either way fail - safe or fail - deadly . On a bomb designed for demolition work , for instance , any faults in the system would probably be made fail - safe . In a bomb designed by someone who wants to hurt people , they would probably try to design the bomb such that it fails deadly . For example , rather than design a bomb where the timer causes the bomb to explode , you instead would design a bomb where the timer is keeping the bomb from exploding . This way , if the timer ran out , was removed , or was shut off , you 'd get the same result . Kablooey . And now I 'm on every government list .","Although this is ELI5 , I feel I can add something to this discussion . There is a lot of misinformation about bomb defusing techniques and rightly so in my opinion . I was an IED ( Improvised Explosive Device ) Operator for over ten years in the military . Here is the point of my little story ; There are simple bombs and there are complex bombs . In one of my first advanced IED courses , we were all given a one foot square plywood box with a lid on the first day of the course . We were told to design and build a bomb using any of the techniques that we already knew and those that we would learn on the course . There were no explosives used it in it obviously , just an electric buzzer that would sound if the device was \" detonated \" Over the weeks , everybody would work on their \" bomb \" during coffee breaks and at lunch time . I must have re - designed mine half a dozen times as I learnt about different types of anti - tamper methods and triggering devices . ( I 'm not going to get into the details for obvious reasons ) On the last day of the course , all 12 of us took our \" bombs \" into one of the workshops and armed them . We drew random numbers and were assigned somebody 's \" bomb \" and were told to attempt and defuse it . All techniques were open to us including X - Ray , bomb disposal robots , and good old hands on in a bomb suit . Every single one of us failed . In other words , every \" bomb \" detonated before it was made safe . The point of the lesson was not lost on us . You will probably never overcome a talented bomb maker that is trying to do you , or other people harm .","I 'm no bomb expert , but drawing from my knowledge of electronics ... Electrical current has two states , flowing and not flowing . Sensors ( such as the one in this bomb ) can detect whether electricity is flowing and use that to choose one of two possible actions . Here , the two actions are \" nothing \" and \" explode . \" You 're assuming that no current flowing is associated with action \" nothing . \" When the timer hits zero , current flows , the sensor notices , and the bomb explodes . In this case , cutting the wire would make it impossible for current to flow , successfully disarming the bomb . But what if we flipped the sensor ? Re - wire it so that it interprets current flowing as\"nothing , \" and no current as \" explode . \" Now , the timer is keeping current flowing as it 's counting , and when it hits zero , the current stops and the bomb explodes . In this case , cutting the wire would stop the current and trigger the bomb . This would be particularly useful if you wanted to make a bomb that 's difficult to disarm , which is why ( I assume ) it 's the kind commonly used by bad guys ."],"1245":["The birth canal can really only be so wide ( jokes notwithstanding ) .

In the case of stuff like \" canned air \" , it 's nothing but propellant ) is a liquid because its under pressure . It 's warm enough to turn into a gas ( vaporize ) , but the pressure keeps it a liquid . When you spray it out of the can , it is no longer under pressure , so it wants to turn into a gas . Changing from a liquid into a gas takes energy , so it grabs that energy in the form of heat from the can , making it colder .","Seems that a lot of people missed the point of the question . The main reason is that heat transfer from your hand into the liquid increases by shaking the can ( due to mixing and forced convection ) , which makes it seem colder as it is drawing heat from your hand faster . If you try it with a can at skin temperature then it wo n't seem to become colder . This is due to heat transfer being proportional to both temperature difference , and a heat transfer coefficient . And shaking increases the heat transfer coefficient .","When a liquid vaporises into a gas , there 's an interaction involving a thing called ' latent heat ' . Pretty much what happens is that when the liquid trys to turn into a gas , it needs an extra bump of energy to push it over the line . For example , when boiling water , you can heat it up to 100 degrees , and then start boiling it . You 'll find that the water is 100 degrees , and the steam will be too . But what caused the water to change into steam if the temperature is still the same ? This is where the extra energy required to cause the phase change comes into play . So in the case of the kettle , the energy is coming from the heat generated by the boiling element . For the aluminium can the heat for the ' boiling ' comes from its surroundings ( because its turning into a gas at below ambient temperature ) . So it effectively feels like its sucking heat out of the air . I probably should note that this is more relevant to the coolness felt when spraying an aluminium can . In terms of shaking one , aluminium is a great heat conductor , so you 'll find that the temperature of the can is about the same as the temperature of your room , but because it transfers heat so well , it feels colder than your room . If you left the can in a place that had a temperature close to your body temperature , you 'd find that the can would n't feel cold any more . The shaking of the can helps the heat transfer from your hand to the liquid inside , as your hand heats the aluminium , shaking the liquid ( which has n't been heated yet ) absorbs some of the heat from the aluminium . If you hold and shake the can for a long enough time you 'll find that it will no longer be cold ."],"1232":["Lizard squad is using a technique called a \" Distributed Denial of Service . \" This is n't a hack or an act of \" breaking into \" a computer - network system .

One way to protect a network from DDOS is to just have LOTS and LOTS of bandwidth and spread your information over LOTS of servers . which of course takes LOTS of money . Another is of course proper network security , a firewall looks for and blocks non important or false network traffic , they try to filter out basic attacks and block repeat signals so that you can free up bandwidth and make yourself harder to hit . Of course the big corporations have very expensive and well maintained firewalls , but no wall is immune if the attacker is dedicated , persistent and willing to do the work . and the last ability a company has to defend themselves are their network maintainers \/ defenders . These people are supposed to be able to see the attacks as they come in and modify the firewall to customize it against the attacks coming in . Most hacking attempts , specially BOT nets , use a one size fits all attack . Each computer firing the same type of \" ammunition \" so a skilled defender can see the pattern and tell the firewall to ignore those packets . But it requires a lot of skill and costs a lot of money to maintain a full time skilled network defense . Most companies have an outside source that they can call upon to protect their networks . Once the attack occurs , they can call up the company to have someone come out to fix the wall and stop the attack . You 'll also notice that most of these attacks are only for a few hours at most and that 's why .

The muscles involved are the same . However they obviously have different meanings in human society .

It is a way of telling others that something is \" not as usual \" ( like crying ) but that it is not * dangerous * ( unlike when someone 's crying ) . Human evolution is characterized by a retention of infant characteristics in the adult ( called * Neoteny * in Biology ) . If the theory above is right , crying ( and laughter ) would also be examples of neoteny : i.e. , there was a time when only infants cried ( and laughed ) before some of them grew up to be adults but kept doing it , and eventually the crying \/ laughing became the majority \/ whole of the human population , since crying ( and laughing ) are still useful ways to share emotions \/ information between social adults , after the rearing of the children has been completed ."],"11385":["\/u \/ theseanything is partly right . Observers have found that the incredible skills of many \" savants \" reflect an incredible amount of time spent obsessively practicing or memorizing one thing --- like say the calendar --- allowing them to perform impressive feats --- like telling you the day of the week for any date within 1000 years almost instantly . But , there 's another aspect to some Autistic savants . Researchers have found that some savants have reduced activity in the parts of the fore - brain that are responsible for what we usually think of as information processing --- basically the part of the brain that packages information in a way we understand . In you , presumably , this part of the brain takes a bunch of lines drawn on a piece of paper and tells you that it 's , say , a house . If you wanted to draw it later , this part of your brain would remember \" house \" and then try to rebuild the lines from that memory , plus the sensory memories that accompanied it . This is why most people 's drawings of a house are house - like , but hardly photo realistic . In the savant , that first step is suppressed . So they see the lines , but they do n't remember it as \" house , \" they remember it as \" bunch of lines . \" So , later , when they try to draw it , there 's no interference from this organizing principle . They just reproduce the lines , sometimes in an order that would make no sense to a non - savant ( part of the roof , than a corner of a window , then the top half of the door ) , and can reproduce it with startling accuracy . The same thing can happen with numbers , allowing for really fast calculation since they do n't have to stop and consider the numbers as \" numbers , \" but just run the operations directly .

Research experience : fMRI , psychophysical , and genetic research into the human visual , auditory , attentional and memory systems . The ' thought voice in your head ' , as with all of your thoughts , originates in your brain . The human brain is the single most complex object in the known universe , and it has large networks of neurons devoted to sound perception and production , among many other things . The human auditory system is capable of ' replaying ' sound memories , which is what happens whenever you think of any sound you 've heard , including when you \" say \" something in your head . More specifically , we have separable mechanisms for planning speech ( stringing together sounds to say ) and producing speech ( actually moving the muscles ) , and we can \" plan \" speech in our heads without actually producing the speech . So , when you see these squiggly symbols we call letters in the patterns we call words and sentences , your brain analyzes them , recognizes them , and then you can replay the sounds of those words in your head that you 've heard before . Commonly , when people use an inner voice to think , they think in the voice that they remember themselves using previously . If you 're not sure , read this sentence out loud then read it in your head ; do those sound similar ? To answer your second question , your memories of your own voice are slightly altered from what everyone else hears because your vocal tract and ears share a head . Physically , sounds are vibrations , and when you generate vibrations in the air using your vocal tract , some of those vibrations are also transmitted through your head . Other people only hear the air vibrations . That 's why your voice sounds a bit off when you hear a recording of it . As for the third question , you do n't have to think in \" your \" voice as you 've heard it before when you speak , but many people do . As an example , try reading this sentence in your head normally , then read it in your head as if you 've just sucked in some helium from a balloon or with your favorite accent . Also , as an aside , I should point out that you do n't have to \" say \" words in your head when you read . Some people only \" see \" the words and do n't go the extra step of pronouncing things . Personally , I read by \" saying \" things in my head , which I suspect is because that is how I was taught to read . That makes it hard for me to imagine reading without \" hearing \" the voice in my head , but it happens .","I 'm just going to take a stab at this since I 'm a neuroscientist . There s a part of your brain called the Wernikes area that is responsible for recognizing object names and placing labels on things .

So I would imagine the \" speech \" in your brain occurs in , or at least includes , the wernikes area without the brocas area .","Have you ever listened to a recording of your voice ?

You say that like they have an expectation that everyone 's going to overclock , so they may as well do it for you -- but that 's not right . Only a TINY percentage of people overclock their CPUs and they do so at their own risk .","CPUs are sold at a given clock speed for one of two reasons : 1 ) It failed QA tests at a higher speed . That does n't mean it 's faulty , it just means there are transistors that ca n't switch fast enough ; when the CPU switched state , some of them missed the transition , and it reflects the previous step . This causes errors in the data . 2 ) CPU manufacture has gotten so consistent and high quality that the manufacturer * ca n't * make shitty , slower CPUs . They got one production line from which they make everything . So they have all these high speed CPUs and a market demand for slower , cheaper processors . What are they to do ? They 're not going to sell their top end product for cheaper , so they 'll lock some of the faster processors at a lower rate to capture that area of the market . So you have to ask yourself , which of these two processors do you own ? How do you tell the difference ?

A much longer explanation is really in order , but here 's the short and overly simplistic version . 1 ) Jews were outsiders . They ( pretty much ) originated as a nomadic people . They kept wandering around to places that other people already called home , places like Egypt and Babylon . We 'll call these non - nomadic people \" landed people . \" Every time Jews showed up to a new town , village , or city , everyone already there saw them as outsiders that wanted to profit from what the \" hard - working \" landed people had made . \" The Jews wanted to take their jobs , \" as the landed people saw it . 2 ) Jews kept to themselves and kept their own traditions , even when living inside of landed peoples ' cities . From their beginning , people of the Jewish faith were a \" devoutly insular group . \" They did not typically marry \" outsiders , \" nor did they stay anywhere for too long , and they commonly did n't invite any outsiders in to participate in their \" Jewish games \" and other fun times . This made landed people feel like the Jews thought they ( the Jews ) were better than them ( whichever landed people were currently getting pissed off at them , be it the Egyptians , the Babylonians , etc ) . So , during a time when a lot of areas were becoming more ethnically diverse ( from wars , political maneuvering , etc . ) , Jews remained mostly ethnically insular . You can find this with the first few generations of almost any immigrant population in the world . The Jews kept it going strong for about 2,500 years though . 3 ) Jews only had one God , whereas a lot of people had many . People hate it when you do n't believe the dumb shit they believe . 4 ) Roman authorities told Christians that Jews were to blame for Jesus ' death . After the Roman Catholic Church came to power under the Roman Emperor Constantine , they attempted to solidify power among their ruled . Their ruled being Christians ( which \" all \" the Romans were supposed to be now ) . Other religions were seen as a threat to their power . Since Jesus was actually Jewish himself , these usurpers quickly needed to find a way to dissuade converts to Christianity from being sympathetic to Jewish people and their faith . \" I know ! Let 's write them in as the people that killed Jesus . Somehow . Even though it does n't really make a lot of sense . \" 5 ) Jews could loan out money and charge interest . Christians could n't . During the rise of Christianity in Rome and then throughout almost the entirety of Europe during the Middle Ages , it was forbidden for Christians to practice \" usury . \" Meaning , a Christian was forbidden to \" loan \" money to others , and then charge them interest on the loan . You know , that thing that every single bank , credit card company , and Wall Street businessperson does all the time now . URL_0 However , Jews were NOT required to obey this mandate . So , a lot of Jewish people ended up getting VERY wealthy by cornering the market on banking .

Jews were outsiders that kept to themselves that people in power used as scapegoats because they were the ancient world 's equivalent of zombies . It was ethically okay to hate them because they had only one god that they totally believed was better than all of your gods and could beat them up in a fight .

And bam , mistrust and hatred . Plus the Christians never really got over that whole ' killing jesus ' thing .","The answers given seem a bit ... limited . Let me try to do better - by mentioning minor stuff likes times and places . Everything simplified , of course\/ * * Pre - Roman times * * Jews lived in an area that was between larger and more powerful empires . They got conquered a lot and probably tried to resist with their beliefs . Other people were polytheistic ( worship multiple gods ) , so Jews were henotheistic ( acknowledge other gods , worship just one ) . When you got conquered in the Middle East , you just had to surrender , accept some more gods into your list of gods and the enemy king would bring yours a sacrifice and accept him too . Jews did n't comply , so their temple was razed . * * Romans * * Palestina , as the Romans called it , bordered on their most dangerous enemies . They were a bit nervous about rebellions there . And the Jews rebelled , so their temple was razed . * * Christianity * * In the 300s Romans started accepting Christianity . Their emperor was now boss of their religion and Christianity . Later on they were just Christians , nothing else . So first Jews were still a dangerous sect , and then they became evil heretics too . * * Early Middle Ages * * Christianity spread over Europe , just like Jews spread over it after their religion became less focused on the temple in Jerusalem ( because it was kinda razed ) . They were tolerated since their religion was similar , but still distrusted . At first this was n't too bad , though - mostly because Christianity was still developing and governments were n't as organised as the Romans yet . Around 622 Islam was invented and it stated that Christians and Jews were \" people of the book \" and enjoyed protection ( as opposed to pagans ) . In an early battle a Jewish tribe betrayed Mohammed and all of its men were beheaded , but otherwise things went well . Though in the 800s they wanted to know who was Muslim and who was n't , so Jews and Christians had to wear yellow medallions . * * Later Middle Ages * * As society became more organised , Jews were restricted by law in regard to what job they could take . Handling money became important , and Christians were n't allowed to charge interest so the Jews were basically made to do it . Often barons and other nobles would borrow money from them . Sometimes they figured it was easier to just kick the Jews out of their city instead of paying them back . Usually other Jews were let right back in ! The Christian Church also became much more powerful , and made kings kill people they did n't like ( the Crusades ) . When the first Crusade began ( against the Muslims ) , in southern Germany they started with killing Jews - because they were n't ( good ) Christians either . In 1215 the most powerful Pope ever , Innocentius III , said all Jews had to wear a yellow badge . Jews sometimes had to wear yellow hats before this time too . So Jews were in a vulnerable position and were hated by the Church . They often were used as a scapegoat and murdered . At the end of the Middle Ages they were sometimes banned from a whole country unless they converted . Sometimes Jews were accused of charging way too much for a loan ( usury ) . Some Jews got really rich and interest rates were as high as 20 - 40 % , so its easy to understand why people might get upset . At the end of the Middle Ages new rules for money were invented however , and Christians could loan people money too . It should be noted that it was n't all bad . At some point the Emperor of Germany and the Netherlands ( Holy Roman Empire ) said Jews were his property . This might seem bad , but that did mean you could n't just go and destroy his property . * * Reformation \/ Renaissance * * Before the Reformation you only had one acceptable form of Christianity in western Europe . Some people did n't like how the Roman Church became super - rich and powerful and wanted to change it . By accident they created a new form of Christianity , Protestantism . This was a positive development for Jews . They were always the only non - Christians living among Christians , so always a vulnerable minority . Now there was another group , and they needed all the help they could get . So while England , Spain , Portugal , France , etc . kicked Jews out , they were accepted in the Netherlands , northern Germany and also in ( Catholic ) Poland . Probably the best place to go was actually the Muslim world ( mostly the Ottoman Empire ) , where they enjoyed most freedom . The Netherlands kicked out their king , the king of Spain , and started an independence war that lasted about 80 years . Jews were accepted because they were needed , but were restricted to living in Amsterdam at first . Lots of Sephardic Jews (= from Portugal and Spain ) came here , as they were forced to convert or be kicked out of Spain . Despite not being all that liked and still being limited , they did fairly well . A handful got really really rich . One town only had a temporary Jewish community because that 's where their vacation houses were . They also got more freedom over time , while the state religion -Calvinism- was very strict . In the 1600s they were actually allowed to openly worship . Catholics and non - Calvinistic Protestants were n't ! In Germany , Poland and parts of Italy Jews had a similar situation , they were allowed because they brought in trade and thus money . In the rest of Europe they were mostly kicked out since the governments did n't like them and did n't need them . Fun fact : In 1688 the Netherlands invaded and conquered England . Part of the invasion force was paid for by a Jew who had been kicked out . * * Enlightenment * * During this time , people started thinking about lots of things including religion . One of the results was that they thought other religions should be tolerated , and not just because it 's convenient . This further improved things for Jews - for a time . This also meant that when France conquered the Netherlands in 1795 , Catholics were finally allowed to have open churches ( forbidden again between 1813 - 1853 ) . * * Nationalism * * Religion stopped being the one thing that united people . So people started looking for other stuff that united them . With better organised governments and improved communication came the idea that people belong to a certain group united by a certain language and living in a certain state . Languages were standardised , dialects were n't allowed in official use anymore . Darwin and Spencer invented the evolution theory , which focuses on inheritance . Some people got the idea that being born somewhere meant you inherited certain characteristics . While Jews had integrated a lot more , they were still outsiders to a degree - also because of their own discrimination of non - Jews ( they 're not allowed to marry them ) . Lots of stuff was going on . There was the industrial revolution , french revolution , Napoleonic wars , lots of other revolutions , European countries grabbing parts of Africa , etc . Governments tried to tighten their grip , people looked for security . Nationalism was a useful tool here . Jews were persecuted in countries like Russia and Hungary in part because of it . * * Hitler * * Hitler used nationalism to start a crusade against the people with the yellow badges . They were easy scapegoats . And Germany had a bit of a history regarding Jews . They were killed in the south during the First Crusade and Luther ( the German who invented Protestantism ) wrote a bunch of bad stuff about them . But why did Hitler need a scapegoat ? Well , Germany was a really new country , and all the good parts of the world had already been divided when they ( and Italy ) showed up . They got some scraps of Africa and some island above Australia . After World War 1 , the British and French used the old UN , the League of Nations , to give themselves most of that . Belgium and Japan got some left - overs . Hitler , actually born in Austria , wanted ' his ' country to be a big badass . So he said all the bad stuff that happened was the Jews ' fault and if they were shipped off to like Madagascar or something Germany would be super - awesome . Since no one ( aside from the Dominican Republic ) wanted his Jews he just killed them instead . * * Israel * * Between 1881 and 1948 hundreds of thousands of Jews , mostly Europeans , moved to Palestine . The local population did n't really like this and but could n't really stop it since the Ottomans ( Turks ) and later on the British were the boss there . The British also used both groups , promising them a country \/ a home . In 1881 there were about 25.000 ( native \/ Palestinian ) Jews , by 1948 there were 660.000 Jews . They had been fighting with Muslim Palestinians for about 30 years . Six million of them ( 35 % of all Jews ) just got murdered . They figured they would only be safe if they had their own country . In 1947 , the UN -again dominated by the huge French and British empires- came up with a plan to divide Palestine . The Jews , 33 % of the population who owned 6 % of the land , got 56 % , including the best parts . According to a report the UN made , the Muslim \/ Arab Palestinian part would not be able to sustain itself . However , what other land were the UK and France they going to give away and make Jews move there ? As you might imagine , the Muslim Palestinians did n't like the plan , especially because a third of them were living on the land given away . The Jews did n't like it either , since they did n't get Jerusalem , but went with it anyway . It did n't work out , the British said \" bugger this \" and left and the Jews quickly grabbed all they could - including ( part of ) Jerusalem . As you might imagine , the Muslims of the former Ottoman Empire who had treated Jews much better than Christians for most of history ( they fought together against Christian crusaders too ) did n't like this . So they attacked and when they lost kicked Jews out of their countries . Now people hate Jews because they believe they killed Jesus , think they have big complot against others like Hitler said or because they took Palestine from the people who lived there ."],"10593":["1 . ) We 're curious \/ dislike the unknown . 2 . ) We recognise patterns . 3 . ) We 're scared of dying . 4 . ) We know very little .

Now , electromagnetic waves are waves made up of alternating electric and magnetic fields . For this discussion , we \u2019re more concerned with the alternating electric fields because charged particles readily react when exposed to them . That is , when a positively charged particle is exposed to an electric field , it experiences a force ( due to the field ) pointing in the direction of the field . By contrast , when a negatively charged particle is exposed to the same field , it experiences a force in the direction opposite to the field . An electromagnetic wave ( like the microwave ) is made up of alternating electric fields , a charge exposed to it will experience forces regularly changing in direction . For water molecules , which are dipoles , the net effect would force the molecules into rotation . Again , since the fields are alternating , the rotation will change from clockwise to counterclockwise at regular time intervals . The agitated water molecules would then possess heat energy that can rub off ( much like friction ) to nearby molecules . If the water molecules are well distributed in the body subjected to the microwave ( like food , for example ) , then the entire body can heat up quickly \u2013 not to mention , uniformly . Electromagnetic waves in the microwave range are most suitable for this purpose because the water molecules readily rotate when exposed to such frequencies .","Microwave ovens use radio waves at a specifically set frequency to agitate water molecules in food . As these water molecules get increasingly agitated they begin to vibrate at the atomic level and generate heat . This heat is what actually cooks food in the oven . Because all particles in the food are vibrating and generating heat at the same time , food cooked in the microwave cooks much more swiftly than food cooked in a conventional oven where heat must slowly travel from the outside surface of the food inward . The same radio waves that cook your food pass harmlessly through plastics , glass , and ceramics . It is this characteristic that keeps plastic plates from melting and glasses from exploding . It is also this feature of microwaves that makes them so energy efficient ; they heat only the food and nothing more . Metals , on the other hand , reflect these radio waves , a characteristic very cleverly put to use in the walls of the microwave such that no waves escape and cook anyone in the kitchen ! All of the waves discussed so far are created inside a device called a magnetron .

It 's not about that game in particular , but they talk about it a bit . So , Chess has a \" book \" . It 's a record of all the tournament games from start to finish . The book is considered to be the end - all - be - all of how to play chess to win . Every move has a name , based on who invented it . If you do n't follow the book , then you 're assumed to be some amateur who is going to lose . But that 's only because you usually are . Bobby Fischer was a young kid up against a seasoned tournament player Donald Byrne . Byrne was playing by the book . Bobby was not . In fact , Bobby allowed his queen to get captured , which usually means it 's lights out soon as it is the most powerful piece and controls lots of the board . But Bobby was not an ordinary amateur . He was a chess savant , and he did n't lose his queen , he sacrificed it in a complex play that totally sunk Byrne in a very complex trap from which there was absolutely no escape . A play like that had never been seen before , was completely unorthodox , and was entirely outside of \" the book \" . Onlookers who were expecting to see Bobby get trounced , instead got to see Byrne get torn apart by a far superior strategy .","Fischer 's play showed a much deeper understanding of chess than most top players had at the time . Most players would just play ' solid positional chess ' , where you slowly try to build up your position until you get an advantage . It 's pretty boring and leads to a lot of draws . Then this 13 year - old kid comes along , sacrifices his Knight ( which Byrne did n't take ) and then even his Queen ( which Byrne DID take ) and just crushes Byrne ! How did that happen ! ? Fischer taught us many things about the game , and this game shows what he taught us very well . [ Here 's a link ] ( URL_0 ) if you want to see someone analyse the game . In case you 're interested , here are the lessons to learn from this game : 1 . Developing your pieces out into the centre quickly . Every piece is better in the centre of the board . ( e.g. A Knight can only move to 2 different squares if it starts from the corner , but to 8 different squares if it starts in the centre . ) If you do n't get your pieces out quickly and your opponent does , you can often get attacked quickly . 2 . Having a safe King . Simple really , if your King is not protected , it can be checkmated easier . Since that wins the game , sacrifices to expose \/ weaken the King are the most common kind of sacrifice . 3 . Having active co - ordinated pieces . This ties in with points 1 and 2 . Having pieces in the centre makes them very active and dangerous to an exposed King . If you look at the game , Fischer puts all of his pieces in the centre of the board defending one another , but Byrne has his only two pieces on opposite edges of the board at one point ! 4 .

Memories in the first person are known as \" field perspective \" . Memories from the third person are known as \" observer perspective \" . Studies have shown that people in Western societies are more likely to remember events in field perspective , whereas people from Eastern societies are more likely to remember events in observer perspective .

Eastern cultures have more of an outside in perspective , looking at things as others ' observations of themselves .

Relative isolation allows this to happen more easily , so that two populations that start of speaking identical version of the same language and accent will slowly drift apart over time if they are n't in constant daily spoken contact with each other . In the case of the 13 colonies , this process was already remarked on by English visitors long before the revolution . Incidentally , this process is still happening . There are two vowel shifts going on right now in North America - one in the [ US Great Lakes states ] ( URL_1 ) , and one just across the border [ in Ontario ] ( URL_0 ) . They are moving in opposite directions , so that the accents are actually becoming * more different * , and linguists are studying this in as much detail as possible . This even applies , interestingly , to people living 10 km apart in the Niagara region . And it should also be noted that American speech as you hear it today is already quite noticeably different from how it sounded just 80 years ago . Normally we 'd never notice such a thing , but it so happens that we have audio recordings from that time , and the differences can be easily noticed . The same thing happens in Canada and the UK , so that people in old movies sound rather odd to modern ears in a way that we ca n't easily define . Even Queen Elizabeth herself has noticeably altered her accent over the 60 years she has been recording Christmas greetings to her subjects , and a lot of people have commented on that over the years . The important point to remember here is that , while American and British speech generally do n't sound all that similar today , they also do n't sound very similar to their ancestors . Someone is going to come in here and say that the British changed their accents while the Americans kept speaking the way they always had , and * * this is simply wrong * * .

So a torch bulb looks similar to a mains bulb , it 's just smaller . And incandescent bulbs are relatively easy to dim : just reduce the voltage reaching them . LEDs are different : the physics of them means that they need a particular voltage to work properly , and you have to put some sort of current - limiting on them , as they get greedier and greedier the hotter they get ( if you do n't limit the current they keep taking more and more current until they burn up - * thermal runaway * ) . So most LED bulbs have a special circuit inside that drops the mains voltage down to something more suitable for the LEDs , and it usually protects the LED from taking too much current so it does n't burn up . And because LEDs need a particular voltage to work right , you ca n't just reduce the voltage to dim them ; you have to take a different approach . PWM ( Pulse width modulation ) is what 's used : it takes advantage of the fact that our eyes ca n't tell the difference between a light that 's permanently on , and one that 's pulsing on and off at high frequency ( anything faster than 100 pulses a second just looks constant to us ) . An LED can be \" dimmed \" by pulsing it on and off , and varying the duty cycle - how much time it 's on versus how much time it 's off . So if you want the LED to be 10 % bright , you can switch it on for a microsecond , then off for 9 microseconds , then repeat - the LED is not actually dimming at all , it 's flashing , but it looks to us like it 's dimmed as our eyes average it all out . Good , reliable LED dimmers are expensive at the moment a ) because they 're not as common , and because b ) they have to cope with the fact that they 're not directly connected to the LED itself - they 're usually connected to an LED * bulb * , which will have aforementioned current - protection and voltage - conversion circuitry inside it . So there are multiple circuits involved , and they may be from different manufacturers and work in subtly different ways . So there 's a lot more going on in LED lighting than there is in incandescent lights ( where you can literally just reduce the voltage to any old bulb and expect it to dim in a natural way )","If you are talking about DC powered dimmers , I 'll let others help you . If you are talking about wall mounted AC power dimmers , the difference is not great . Dimmers use phase control of the AC waveform . They stay off for part of the cycle and turn on for the rest of it . This happens 120 ( or 100 ) times a second because each cycle has a positive and negative peak . Leading edge dimmers are the older type . They will work with all incandescents , transformers for vow voltage halogens , and some LEDs . They start each half cycle * * on * * and switch * * off * * somewhere in the middle of a cycle . Trailing edge dimmers are the newer type . They will work with all incandescents and most dimmable LED bulbs . They start each half cycle * * off * * and switch * * on * * somewhere in the middle of a cycle . Without getting out of ELI5 territory , it is the way the LEDs handle the sudden rise or decrease when the dimmer turns on or off in the middle of a cycle which matters . For LEDs , stability and dimmability to low levels usually mandate the trailing edge type .","* Incandescent bulbs are just tiny wires that glow . * You can dim them just by lowering the voltage . * You can lower then voltage with a simple adjustable resistor . * LEDs use DC power of a very specific voltage . * The AC \/ DC adapters built into each LED light bulb only work at a specific voltage so lowering the voltage will cause them to not work properly . * You * can * dim LEDs by turning them on \/ off very rapidly and then adjust how long they are on compared with how long they are off .

What 's more , when you borrow more than one payment of money , there are a few ways to pay it off . Either you pay constant amounts ( A ) , or a gradient amount ( G ) . So , to sum it up , you 've got P - the initial amount of the loan ( principle ) F - The final amount of the loan A - The cost of a constant payment amount G - The gradient amount , or the amount increasing or decreasing each month n - the number of ' ticks ' ( eg , months if paying monthly ) i - the interest Here 's the cool thing . Interest is exponential . The actual formulas for calculating these are pretty tricky , and humans do n't naturally think in exponents , so we 've compiled all of this information into ' conversion factors ' . This boils down to a table , which answers questions similar to > \" I took out a $ 10k loan at 3 % interest with a monthly payment . What is that monthly payment for a 24 months payback period ? \" > \" I deposited $ 100k in a 3 % per year interest bearing account compounding monthly . What do I have at the end of 2 years ? \" And these conversion factors are all located [ here ] ( URL_0 ) The first example is the \" Find A \/ P \" column . This is because we know the principle ( P ) and want to know the periodic payment amount ( A ) . We also know the interest ( 3 % , assume per year ) and we know that it 's monthly , with 24 ticks . That 's ( 3 % per year)\/(12 months in a year ) , or .25 % per tick . So find the 1\/4 % interest tables , find the A \/ P column , and scroll down to n=24 . The factor is * .0430 * . That means that no matter what amount you borrowed , if you have i=3 % yearly , 24 month period , compounded monthly , then the ratio of A to P is .0430 . Since we know that P is $ 10k , then the monthly payment is $ 430 . Bam , done . The reason this field is ' economic analysis ' is because since everything is ratios , it allows you to analyze what options are better for you . Just multiply that $ 430 a month to 24 ticks to get $ 10320 , and you can see that you spent $ 320 on interest over 2 years . That 's a short payback period . Try doing that with $ 100k and a 30 year mortgage to see where things blow up . * NOW , TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION * - People do n't force you to pay a periodic amount ( A ) . That 's just convenient math . What 's most important is to realize that the interest that you are paying is a function of the money that you owe them . That 's like paying a bill for having internet - just , you are paying the bill for having money owed to someone . You are 100 % allowed to pay more towards principle , once your interest is paid off for the month , if you can . Money is fungible anyways - when that ' tick ' hits ( eg , every month ) it 's as if the interest gets added to the principle ( compounded , although compounding usually happens after some time ) and 100 % of your payment goes to principle . The reason people tell you how much is going towards each is so that you can more easily see the effects of paying off more of your principle . In general , it is a very good idea , unless the interest is low enough that you can make that money back with other investments ."],"16454":["It 's not really * drowning * at that point .

I ca n't give you an exact reason because I think there are multiple reasons it is or hit or miss . But if you wanted some anecdotal evidence on what increases my chances for it working : 1 ) Empty stomach for sure . I try to not eat about 2 - 3 hours before I plan on taking it . This means your stomach is emptying from its last meal , but you wo n't be starving either . 2 ) I drop mine in a small amount of water and let it dissolve first . I then rinse the glass and drink that to get any residual drug on the glass . 3 ) Anywhere from 15 - 30 minutes before , I take an antacid \/ H2 blocker combo like [ this ] ( URL_0 ) . Someone with a little more education on this may correct me but my reasoning for this was because some drugs are more absorbed in the stomach and some are better absorbed in the small intestine . I believe that Ambian is better absorbed in the small intestine . ( This is why giving it with food would be a bad idea as that means your stomach is going to hold on to the food until it is broken down and then it will begin to be released to the small intestine . So the drug is just sitting there in your stomach instead of being absorbed . ) Right , so the reason I think Ambian is absorbed in the small intestine is because if you look at the drug name , it 's called zolpidem tartrate . Again , not certain , but I believe the purpose of the tartrate is to \" soak - up \" protons so that the environment is a little more basic , Leaving the drug in its uncharged form , which is the form it needs to be in order to be absorbed . So , if you are like me , and have constant heartburn anyway , it seems to help with absorption . Also , the antacid I linked has famotidine in it . There is an analogue of this drug called cimetidine , which is known to have drug interactions in the liver . For Ambian , there is some evidence of a slight interaction with cimetidine although I ca n't find the paper right now . If I remember correctly , this just means that your liver would take longer to break down Ambian , thereby prolonging it 's effect . Which would n't be so great if you had to be up early .

The colloquial one is probably the most useful one . Technically speaking : Linux is a kernel . As saintkrieg explained , the kernel is the smallest part of the operating system . It 's the part that does very simple and low - level things like talking with your hard - drive , running and managing other programs to make sure they do n't misbehave , and reading input from your mouse and keyboard . Colloquially speaking : Generally , when people are talking about Linux , they are talking about an entire ecosystem of software that goes with it . In other words , in this colloquial usage , it 's kind of arbitrary where you distinguish the actual operating system from the software that runs on it . I mean , is Firefox part of Windows , or is it just an application that you run on Windows ? Colloquially , there is actually no answer to this : As a web - browser , it is pretty important program . However , Firefox runs on the Linux kernel , as well as the Windows kernel and the Mac OSX kernel . So , it 's kind of arbitrary where we draw the line . Linux , thus , in this most common usage , refers to all the applications you run on top of the Linux kernel , a giant pool of open source software . This includes a \" Desktop Environment \" , such as Unity or KDE , which gives you icons on your desktop and stylish X buttons on your windows , and applications to run on it , such as LibreOffice and Firefox . The purpose of \" distributions of Linux \" is to select combinations from this big pool of open source software that all work well together . Ubuntu , Mint , or Fedora , for example , make certain choices about which Desktop Environment and applications to use . By running a distro like Ubuntu , you are promised that you will have good software out - of - the - box to run on your computer . For example , the people who make Ubuntu choose to include Unity for a Desktop Environment ( this is what makes the bar of icons on the left of the screen , and the minimize and close buttons on your windows ) , Firefox for a web browser , and LibreOffice for an office suite . Could you have just the Linux kernel without all these extras , without a Desktop Environment and such applications ? Technically , yes , but it 'd be pretty useless . You would n't have any programs to run on the kernel , so you 'd really have no way of using your computer .","Going to go for an ( oversimplified ) analogy that a 5 year old could understand . As others here have said , Linux itself is what you call a \" kernel \" , or the low - level software that interacts with the hardware on your computer itself . Now , think of the hardware of your computer ( CPU and the like ) as the engine of a car . The engine by itself is impressive and powerful , but essentially useless . You have to hook it up to something in order to get anything out of it . So think of Linux as being the transmission - it transforms the energy of the engine into something useful ( moving around ) . At this point , you have the groundwork of a vehicle - and in our analogy , a functional desktop computer - all set up . But an engine with a transmission connected to four wheels still is n't going to do you much good ... you need to be able to sit in the thing and drive it . This is where the different distributions come into play . You can think of them as being like the body \/ frame of the car . When you get in and drive , you do n't see the engine and transmission doing any work , you just turn the key and push the gas . Basically , and this is a stretch but to keep things simple , everyone who 's using Linux has the same underlying components : hardware ( an \" engine \" which differs from system to system ) and something that makes this hardware accessible and useful ( a \" transmission \" which is more or less the same for everyone , but there are exceptions^1 ) . The interface ( distro ) , which is there so humans can actually use it and see stuff happening on their screen ( like a frame , you physically get in this and use the controls ) is what makes the vast majority of the difference . -------------------------------------------- ^1 The Linux kernel is open source , so any group of people that makes their own distribution can modify it in any way that they want in order to get any number of desired effects .","Linux itself is a kernel . A kernel is the key component to an operating system . It is in charge of telling the other parts of the OS what to do . Examples of Linux based systems include Debian , Ubuntu , and Mint .

We 'll call it the State of Calville . Calville gets 10 Representatives to send to the US House of Representatives . If you 're a Democrat you would like as many Democrats as possible ; if you 're a Republican you would like as many Republicans as possible . Because Calville gets 10 Representatives it needs 10 districts . Each district = 1 Representative . How do you draw the borders to make these districts ? One way is to draw the borders to make sure that your party gets as many of those 10 Representative spots as possible . There are 2 basic ways to do that . 1 . Put ( groups of ) voters together . 2 . Put ( groups of ) voters apart . 1 . Let 's pretend a group of people always vote for Republicans : people over 6 feet tall . And you 're a Democrat and you 're in charge of drawing the borders of the 10 districts . You can draw it so that every person over 6 feet tall is in one , and only one , district . It could look [ something like this ] ( URL_0 ) or [ like this ] ( URL_1 ) . You 're basically giving up that one district . You know that Democrats will never be able to win it . But you also know that Democrats will have a * * much better * * chance in the other 9 because all the Republican voters are in 1 district . So you 're drawing the borders so you get 9 districts \/ Representatives and Republicans get 1 district \/ Representative . You 're basically using the ability to make borders to get the electoral outcome you want and not the electoral outcome the people \/ voters want . 2 . Let 's keep going with our hypothetical . You 're a Democrat writing the rules and you only care about getting as many Democrats elected as possible . Let 's also say 20 % of people in Calville are over 6 feet tall . They will vote Republican no matter what . A fair person might say something like : at least 20 % of the population wants Republican Representatives , therefore it 's fair that * at least * 2\/10 Representatives should be Republican . But you , you do n't care about fair or what voters want . You only want to win . ( Bastard ! ) So you take that 20 % and you spread them around . You make sure that each district has 20 % , but no more , of people over 6 feet tall . That way you might be able to win all 10 districts \/ Representatives ! So even though a fair outcome would be at least 2 Republicans , you 've abused your power to make sure you get the result you want and not what the people \/ voters want . If a Republican is from a district which is 90 % people over 6 feet tall then they do n't really have to worry about being re - elected .

Postmodernism was the era after Modernism and can be seen either as a direct response or a continuation of Modernism . The most basic idea behind the difference of Modernism and Postmodernism is this : Modernism constructs and Postmodernism deconstructs . Modernism was all about the \" new . \" New forms , new art , new philosophy , new styles . Postmodernism questions and contradicts and pokes holes at what is current and new . Think about two coworkers in a meeting . One coworker has a ton of ideas for the company and keeps saying one after the other after the other , about this new direction he imagines for the company . The second guy just sits there thinking , \" All of those ideas are bullshit , and you 're not going to see any of them through ! \" That second guy is postmodernism . You mention \" breaking the fourth wall \" as a postmodern device . Well , you 're correct . \" Breaking the fourth wall \" is a great way to question or deconstruct the process of a performance .","Since you mention breaking the fourth wall , I 'm going to assume you 're talking about postmodernism in fiction \/ literature . Yes , there 's quite a bit more to it than that . So basically , modernism was a movement that came out of the 19th and 20th centuries . Modernist authors and artists wanted to reject the old traditional ways of writing novels and poems , and making art of any kind . \" Make it new \" was the motto . They did things like have books where the narrator does n't tell the story in a linear fashion , but jumps from topic to topic , trying to make it seem like everyday human thought . POSTmodernism took many of those same concepts , but tweaked them a bit . Everything still needed to be new , but often \" new \" came out of remixes of the old . So you have comic books like Alan Moore 's * Watchmen * that throws in symbolism and high - brow literary techniques while telling a story about superheroes ( and then * Time Magazine * called it one of the best books of the century ) . You also have a lot of \" metafictional elements , \" such as breaking the fourth wall . This is what the show * Community * is talking about when they call things \" meta . \" They mean that their fictional universe is playing with boundaries of what exists in the TV show and what exists in the real world . And the really confusing thing about all this is , the lines between Modernism and Postmodernism are pretty fuzzy . To some people , they 're the same movement , which is why I mention both . A nice example that everyone knows : think * Indiana Jones ; * those movies are based on the adventure serials of the 1930 's and 1940 's , which were not well - respected by critics . But George Lucas and Steven Spielberg added in elements from different genres of books and movies , and made the character fail over and over as opposed to the stereotypical hero who can do no wrong , and you 've got a box office and critical hit . Tl;dr version : postmodernism is about breaking with traditions and playing with what 's \" normal \" in art . Basically every movie , book , or painting made in the last 50 years has elements of postmodernism .","So far so good on all the responses . I want to also point out that this break from Modernism is said to have come about during World War II . The idea goes that World War II birthed atrocities that the human race had never seen on a scale it could never imagine ( think the Holocaust , Dresden , Hiroshima , and Nagasaki ) . Some people say the human psyche ( read : optimism ) was irreparably broken , and of those high - brow archetypes that had perpetuated up until then -- Truth , Love , etc -- couldn't really exist in the actual world . So you 'll see poetry that was still holding onto meter and form completely desintegrate ( like [ Howl ] ( URL_1 ) or [ For Love ] ( URL_0 ) ) , literature that breaks cultural taboo on every level ( see On the Road ) , and music became more and more discordant ( even popular music like the Beatles showed the morph from idyllic to bizarre ) , to reflect that feeling of \" jaded . \" Basically , yeah , you can have the pretty and frilly , but is it REAL ?

For an object with the mass of our Sun , for example , the event horizon ( Swarzschild radius ) is approximately 3 km . But of course the Sun is much , much larger than 3 km in diameter , so if you were to somehow be 3 km from the Sun 's centre , most of its gravitational pull would be coming from outside that radius . Once you compress the whole of our Sun into a body of 3 km or less , runaway gravitational attraction would take over and it would become a black hole -- same mass , but in a much smaller volume .","You do n't observe singularity in stars , because they 're still ' pushing ' out from inside . That 's because of the radiation generated by the fusion going on in the core . They stay at the same rough size because the force pulling them into a singular centre point ( gravity ) is opposed by an equal and opposite force from the energy radiating outwards . If you squashed the sun down a bit smaller , it 'd be more dense , so there 'd be more fusion occuring . That would un - balance those two forces , because there 's more radiative force while gravity has n't changed , and hey presto , the Sun expands back to its original size . You would see the star become compressed into a singularity eventually , if it meets a few criteria : * The star must have stopped fusion .

They believe that if you want good medical care when you get sick , you should be a productive member of society when you are well .","Some people feel like they 'd be paying more into such a system than they 'd get out . There is another deeper economic reason , though . The market as a whole , if left to its own devices , values different things than a government controlled monopsony . ( A monopsony is like a monopoly , except in a monopoly you have lots of customers and one seller . In a monopsony , you have lots of sellers and one customer . ) Once all health care providers are dealing with a single customer \u2013 the government \u2013 that customer is free to set the terms of the deal completely . Whatever that one customer values all the providers will race to provide . If that customer values low price , then for all providers , lowering prices is suddenly of paramount importance . Here is the key difference : * everyone * must pay into this system . No one can opt out . That means if you want to get a more expensive policy , you do n't just pay the difference for that more expensive policy , you pay for both the government provided one ( in the form of taxation ) and the private one . You are essentially double - paying for the cheaper care . This matters because it means that some percentage of the population that would have bought the more expensive policy before will not be able to afford it , or wo n't want to . This creates a dynamic where , in addition to the single customer incentive , now the decisions of the market itself are placing yet more emphasis on driving costs down of even the private policies . From the supply side , this means that health care providers will find they have much lower margins and health care becomes a race to the bottom . There is less money for long - term reinvestment in innovation and R & D. This has indeed happened in every single country that has nationalized health care ( it 's no coincidence that most of the world gets its drugs from American pharmaceutical companies ... we're one of the few economies that generates enough profit for these companies to make drug research worthwhile ) . I can help to frame the discussion in terms of a product that people do n't associate with morality .

And Apple would not have had the money to continue innovating ... we'd all have one , but we 'd all still be using the first generation iPhone . Paradoxically , we 'd all look around and be quite happy that everyone has one ... even though in the alternate universe we 're in now , anyone that wants to can go get themselves a 3rd gen iPhone for next to nothing and would be much better off ! Hopefully this gives you some idea of why many people are against universal health care . My worry is that , if the US does lose our ability to innovate in this space , where will new drugs be developed ? Right now the US provides the vast majority of the world 's R & D in this area ... I fear that once we ca n't do it anymore , that 's it ; our kids and their kids will have more or less the same health care we do today .","The insurance and healthcare lobbies , just like all big lobbies , are powerful , and they can influence the national discourse to some extent .

You add a little fuel somewhere in the process , which ends up igniting either from a spark plug or from the high pressure and temperature environment in the cylinder . This causes the pressure and temperature to further skyrocket , and that can be harnessed by allowing the working fluid of air and exhaust to expand against a piston connected to a crankshaft . Then , you blow out the remaining exhaust particles , which take up space that you 'd rather fill with fresh air ( again , oxygen ) in the next engine cycle . Repeat that at high speeds , having typically 10 - 200 combustion events every second per cylinder in the case of a piston - cylinder engine , or having one long continuous event in the case of a turbine .","Your standard four - stroke engine runs as follows : stroke 1 : As the piston expands the chamber , fill it with a fuel \/ air mixture . stroke 2 : The piston compresses the chamber . A spark is lit just before the compression stroke completes . stroke 3 : The spark ignites the fuel , the explosion pushing the piston which is attached to a crankshaft , causing it to spin . stroke 4 : As the piston returns , the exhaust is pushed out from the chamber . This process repeats , keeping the crankshaft spinning which ultimately causes the wheels of your vehicle to spin .","Well , you have 2 main types of engines : diesel and conventional . I 'll explain each in turn . First of all , your conventional engine usually runs on a four step process . Step 1 : Intake . The engine pulls in a mixture of fuel and air , which pushes the cylinder to its maximum volume . Step 2 : Compression . The piston pushes the mixture to a predetermined pressure ( which will cause a bigger bang ) . Step 3 : Combustion . The spark plug at the top of the cylinder ignites the mixture , pushing down the piston , which creates the power needed to run your car . Step 4 : Exhaust . The piston pushes the leftover mixture out of the cylinder . ( If you are using a much more inefficient two stroke engine , steps 1 and 4 happen at the same time , as well as steps 2 and 3 ) . Diesel engine : I wo n't go over the whole cycle again for the Diesel engine , but I 'll highlight the key differences . The fuel is obviously different , and this leads to the ability to compress the fuel to a much higher pressure . In fact , that 's the whole point of a Diesel engine . The spark plug ignites the fuel mixture for a conventional engine , but in a Diesel engine the fuel ignites spontaneously as soon as it reaches a certain pressure . Additional note : if you were to directly compare a Diesel engine to a conventional engine at the same exact temperature and pressure , the conventional would actually be more efficient . However , since the Diesel engine operates at such high pressures , the Diesel engine ends up being much more efficient than the conventional engine , I.E. You get much more bang for your buck .

I \u2019m going to try my hardest to give you the * main * details without becoming biased . I 'm sure you 've noticed by now that your face , particularly from the front of your neck up to about your nose , is doing some pretty funny things . Namely , because of puberty , you 're starting to get these rough , tiny hairs everywhere . I do mean * everywhere * , amirite ? But ! Let 's focus on the face for now . We 'll call the collection of hair from your lower neck up to your nose \/ ears your ~~beard~~ ThunderBeard . The speed and thickness with which your ThunderBeard will grow is mostly determined by genetics so do n't let anyone fool you about how \" shaving makes it grow faster \/ thicker \/ etc \" . Pa ' ( and even Ma ' ) gave you the genetic materials that have already determined your ThunderBeard \u2019s growth . Embrace that . There are quite a few theories about the biological reasoning behind men growing ThunderBeards but they all seem to focus on a man finally being sexually mature and healthy . ( Side \/ fatherly - note , do n't be a fool ; wrap your tool . Every . Time . ) At any rate , here you are , producing a ThunderBeard like no other . There are some very important things you should become familiar with when it comes to maintaining it . * * First * * , you should get to know your ThunderBeard . I guarantee you that yours does n't grow like your old man 's or your friends ' . Let it grow a bit and caress it with your fingertips . Get a feel for how it 's growing , how the hair sweeps or changes in direction , and specifically , see if you can * learn * the direction in which your hair grows ( up , down , slightly to the left , etc ) . Knowing the general direction of your ThunderBeard will help you when it comes time to shave ! * * Second * * , you \u2019ll need to find a blade with which to actually cut your ThunderBeard . There are almost limitless possibilities here but the important thing to know about the blade is what it \u2019s actually trying to do . Single - blade systems aim to cleanly slice through your ThunderBeard . With multi - blade razors , typically , the \u201c first \u201d blade tries to \u201c lift \u201d the hair while the remaining blades try to slice it . Electric razors use a scissor - cutting method to get the job done . You will need to experiment a little and figure out what style blade works best for you and your skin . Electric razors are typically fast and forgiving ( you do n\u2019t get cut very often ) , but can be expensive and irritating . Single - blade razors can be cheap but are often not very forgiving . Multiple - blade razors seem to be a middle - of - the - road tool for most folks . ( Side \/ fatherly - note , please do n\u2019t let this devolve into some debate about how one style blade is better than others . Dif\u2019rent strokes for dif\u2019rent folks . ) * * Third * * , you should get familiar with your skin and how it reacts to a few products . ( Side \/ fatherly - note , wash your face at least twice a day . Morning \/ night ; shower \/ before - bed ; whatever your schedule is . ) Unless you go the electric razor route , you \u2019ll need to find some sort of shaving medium that works for you . Some prefer gel , some prefer lather from a can or cake - soaps , some go with creams , and some prefer just water . You \u2019re looking for something that helps the razor slide across your skin , helps soften your ThunderBeard , and does n\u2019t irritate your baby - fresh cheeks . You \u2019ll also need to locate an aftershave . Shaving creams and the actual act of shaving tend to strip your skin of moisture and nutrients and that can cause a pretty weird sensation on your neck and face . Aftershave helps replenish those lost nutrients . You \u2019re looking for something that soothes any irritation ( burning or itching ) , moisturizes your skin , and , as a bonus , see if you can find something that smells pleasing . You \u2019ll need to experiment with your shaving medium and your aftershave here because each of these products will behave differently in the way they react to your skin and the way they help you maintain your ThunderBeard . ( Side \/ fatherly - note , try to buy sample or travel sizes of various products before you decide on one . * Try * at least three shaving mediums and aftershaves . ) * * Fourth * * , find a style of ThunderBeard that works . You may wish to completely void yourself of your ThunderBeard or you may wish to keep it as a goatee or just a mustache . At any rate , experiment ! Work with what you have to create a style that you feel suits you best . ( Side \/ fatherly - note , experiment now while you do n\u2019t have a job that mandates you maintain some style of ThunderBeard . ) * * Lastly * * , some advice when it comes time to actually do the deed of shaving . Your ThunderBeard is at its most vulnerable when it \u2019s fresh out of a hot shower . The hot water helps soften the hairs and open the pores of your face , making shaving considerably easier . If you ca n\u2019t come out of a hot shower before you shave , try running a washcloth under hot water and ( if it \u2019s cool enough ) pressing it against your ThunderBeard for a few beats before you shave . Also , while you \u2019re learning , try shaving \u201c with the grain \u201d of your ThunderBeard . ( This is where your knowledge of the direction your hair grows comes into play . ) Shave \u201c with \u201d the direction of your hairs for a few days . If that does n\u2019t irritate your skin , you can try shaving \u201c across the grain \u201d ( not with , not against \u2026 \u201c across \u201d ) . If across the grain does n\u2019t bother you , try shaving \u201c against the grain \u201d ( the complete opposite direction the hair is growing ) for a super - smooth shave . Consider saving any against the grain shaving for important dates . Also ! Do n\u2019t forget to have a little fun . :)","I wet my face with warm water and do n't dry it for a minute . When it 's still somewhat wet , I apply shaving cream and let that sit for about 30 seconds to a minute . Then I shave . If I shave after a shower , I feel the same , but you always risk the cuts bleeding afterwards . You use after shave , but it will still trickle out , at least for me , which I can deal with if I 'm not going somewhere so I can around with tissue on my face to stop it , but if I do it before a shower , it tends to just wash off in the shower and not bleed afterwards . After the shower , I apply after shave .","Take a hot shower , exit shower while room is still humid , shave going against or with the grain as you find comfortable .

Pretend we have three friends : Al , Bob , and Charlie . * Al is rich and his parents give him lots of money . * Bob is poor and his parents ca n't afford to give him any money . * Charlie is trustworthy ; everyone knows Charlie would never steal a dime from his friends . Al , being a VERY nice guy , decides he wants to help Bob out . So he decides that he 's going to take $ 50 he 's saved up and give it to Bob . However he 's worried about Bob . Bob has never had money before and if he gives him the $ 50 all at once , then Bob might blow it on stuff like candy and soda within a week , when what Bob really needs is lunch money for the rest of the school year . Al is also a little lazy . He does n't want to bother slowly handing the money out himself , so he decides to give the money to Charlie to dole it out for him . This relationship is called a TRUST because Al TRUSTS Charlie to do what has been asked of him and not steal the money . The money is called a TRUST FUND , because it 's the whole point of the TRUST . So now everyone benefits : Al gets to be a good Samaritan without all the hard work , Bob gets money as he needs it , and even Charlie benefits because he 'll loan the money he has n't given out yet to other kids and they 'll pay him back with interest , which he 'll get to keep for himself !","Let 's start with Trusts . Let 's say you are rich and afraid that you are going to die , because when you die , your kids will fight over all of your money and it will ruin the family . Furthermore , they will take all your money and spend it too fast , and it will ruin their lives . So what you do is set up a ' business ' ( trust ) and give all your money to the business . The business does not sell cars or make computers . It just holds onto your money and pays taxes ( on investment gains ) . The business is run by your most trusted friends ( trustees ) who will make sure your family does n't spend the money too fast . Now , when you die , you have no money for the kids to fight over . Instead , the business ( trust ) ' lives on ' and your friends ( trustees ) give the money to your kids slowly . A trust can own anything ( houses , boats , cars , accounts ) . Any bank account owned by a trust is considered a Trust Fund . For the 12 year olds : A trust is a business that does not conduct business . Since the trust is not a person , it ca n't get sick , die , or go to jail . Trustees make the decisions for the trust , but trustees DO NOT own any of the assets of the trust . The trust owns the assets for the beneficiaries of the trust . ( The trustees can be the beneficiaries ) Why is this important ? Because in the U.S. we have estate taxes ( we are so sorry to hear that you died , here is a bill from the IRS for your family ) . You are tax on all the assets you own over a specific amount . But if the assets are owned by a trust and NOT owned by you , those assets will not be a part of your estate and therefore will not be a part of the estate tax . ( the rules for estate taxes are quite a bit more complicated than that , but you get the point )","I 'll expand on personal trust funds ( corporate trust funds , meaning ones for universities , charities , and debt issues I can cover in another post but I 'm a little fuzzy on them ) . A personal trust fund is basically an account set up by an individual using a sum of money that is held with a financial institution ( almost all large banks have trust divisions and there are several stand alone trust institutions ) that is governed by a contract set out by the individual starting the account . The financial institution is bound by law to administer the account the way the contract outlines . The beauty of trust funds is that the individual can structure the fund however he \/ she wants . Items in a typical contract include 1 ) where you want the money invested ( risky or less risky ) 2 ) time frames on when money can be withdrawn 3 ) for what the money can be drawn down for , and 4 ) who can withdraw the money . The terms are completely flexible and up to you . Here are examples of trust fund terms I have seen : 1 ) \" Starting at age 18 , my son can withdraw up to $ 50k a year but can also withdraw an unlimited amount of money if it goes to education \" , 2 ) \" Money sits in safer investments and goes to my grandchildren in 2080 . If no surviving grandchildren , goes to closest family members \" , 3 ) \" Per year , son can withdraw up to the amount that he made this year from his regular job \" ( this is known as a W-2 trust and is meant to encourage people to work in order to get the ' free ' money ) , 4 ) \" Daughter can withdraw unlimited amount for education purposes , gets 50 % of total amount when she turns 40 , remainder to be split evenly amongst her children . At any point in time , I as the starter of this fund can cancel this fund and take back all the money . \" Lastly , there are government regulators , auditors , and legal teams that ensure the financial institution is administering the account in accordance with the contract .

Some configurations will allow a little piece to go flying off while others will stay together . At Chernobyl , Uranium atoms were being split in half in the nuclear reactors . When uranium splits in half , the two smaller atoms that remain ( each being about half the size of U ) are typically unstable ( they have too many neutrons ) . So they convert neutrons to protons in what we call * beta decay . * This happens slowly and releases some energy as it goes . That energy can cause biological damage and is therefore dangerous ( especially if ingested ) .","Radioactivity is usually caused by an unstable nucleus . This is caused when the nuclei are very large ( ie Uranium , Plutonium , etc . ) or if they are poorly assembled with an unstable construction with excessive or lacking neutrons ( Potassium 40 ) . When an atom decays it separates into two particles , a ( often ) hydrogen nucleus and another element slightly smaller . Chernobyl hosts a lot of strontium and cesium which are the products of a nuclear reaction . This is different from a decay scheme . Large elements like Uranium and Plutonium split into large chunks like cesium and strontium .

First thing you do in the morning on a farm is collect the eggs from the hen house and milk the cows . That explains milk and eggs . I imagine the American lunch has a lot to do with school .

Dinner is a more elaborate affair because the time to cook a meal all day was there . Housewives needed something to do all day , and cooking dinner fell to them . In the fifties and sixties it was wildly advertised that a proper wife had dinner waiting for the husband when he got home . It is all just tradition and advertising . Edit : forgot sweet breakfast .

If a developer notices that Richard Nixon is winning every test game , they might tone down Watergate .","> It seems like it would require a lot of math . Does it ? Yes . I 'm writing my doctoral thesis in comp sci on game development and balance is a big part of it . I ca n't tell you specifically what Firaxis does , but to some degree things can be a lot of math , which are well suited to ELI5 because well , the math depends on your combat model and that is game specific . But there are a lot of fairly profound design and philosophical choices . Should a phalanx unit be able to defend against a tank ? With what probability ? Math lets you tweak parameters to make whatever you want happen , but ultimately what the math should do is a design choice . When it comes to more orthogonal choices - like the faction bonuses , where one guy gets bonus money and another guy gets bonus diplomatic relations well , they are n't really balanced in any purely theoretical math sense . It 's not really realistic to try and weight 1 unit of money versus diplo reputation . The idea is to basically run the game a LOT , AI on AI , player on player , AI on player and figure out the probabilities of winning and losing . In a game like Civ where a lot of the game is AI factions against AI factions you can do a lot of balance by just automating the game and seeing how it goes , and keep going until a large enough sample sets gives you close to equal probabilities for each faction . Enter into the discussion : Starcraft . Starcraft is an esport rather than just a single player game . In this case your tolerances on advantages to a given faction are much lower than they are for something like Civ ( or the other extreme , Skyrim , where you can kill the last boss with about 3 hits if you are so inclined ) . Balance really works in multiple layers - units against units , collections of units from an era against other collections from an era ( say early game \/ late game , or ' ages ' in Civ ) , overall strategies that may encompass multiple eras against each other , and then all of the indirect ( non military ) systems balances against each other . Oh , and in Civ thinks are heavily biased by starting location and conditions , this is deliberate - in SC you 're trying to give everyone an equal chance , in a historical game you 're trying to give a realistic starting condition . In civ the randomness is part of what makes the fun of the game , and optimizing around random conditions , so each game is different . Edit : One thing to add . Sometimes good balance is about thinking outside the immediate set of equations around your combat and say ' lets add reload delay to this weapon , shrink the clip size , or to change how the scope works ' or the like and you get away from bullet damage and rates of fire as big overarching math concepts and change how players can actually use the tools given to them .","It can vary a lot depending on the type of game but usually problems in balance are identified through extensive playtesting and\/or collecting and analysing statistics , etc . Once balance issues are identified here needs to be serious thought about different balancing measures and the consequences of each option . Some game designers do n't play the game that they are ' balancing ' or bother putting any serious thought into the effects of balance changes and just pull shit out of their ass ( e.g. Alan Kertz aka Demize99 .

Banking regulations would make this particularly difficult , because right now , banks wo n't touch marijuana money .","You can not patent a natural product . Drug companies will patent a delivery system , like a patch or tablet coating that allows for unique dissolution , and market that .

Games require a lot of background processing since the player is inputing controls that affect the game , and the game has to figure out how to respond . Because of all the extra ' thinking ' the machine has to do with video games , there is less room for more polygons , effects , etc . One of the main struggles of high end games is how to optimizes graphics while still having a game that runs smoothly .","To really understand the answer to this question , you need to have an idea of how graphics work in a video game . To start , graphics of a video game are constructed real time . In computer programming , this means that the graphics are calculated based off of the immense amount of data that the game is processing in the background every single frame . But what is a frame ? Think about those [ animation flip books ] ( URL_1 ) where each different page has the same scene , but slightly modified . Flip them really fast and you get the illusion of animation . This is basically what happens in video game code , where each different \" page \" is a frame . Each frame must be calculated by the computer 's hardware based on what has changed within the game world . This includes what input the user has given , as well what the program has determined should happen next . These calculations take time . The more advanced the graphics , the more time these calculations will take . This is where we hit a problem . In order to fool the brain into thinking it 's seeing continuous animation , the frames must be delivered to the monitor anywhere between 30 - 60 frames per second . If a frame takes longer than 1\/30th of a second to compute , then you start seeing \" graphics lag \" . Imagine if someone showed you an animation flip book , but flipped the pages way too slow . [ Here 's a video example ] ( URL_2 ) of what that looks like . The more detailed the graphics , the longer it will take for each frame to be rendered to the screen . The solution to this is to simply get better hardware . A more advanced graphics card is usually the solution to being able to render frames faster . More and more advanced hardware tied with better programming methods is what has allowed us to go from [ this ] ( URL_4 ) to [ this ] ( URL_3 ) .

It might take months to render each and every frame , but after it 's all done , it can be played back instantly without having to be calculated again . This is why cutscenes will always look more realistic than gameplay . If we can ever get such advanced hardware that able to create frames that are totally and completely realistic graphics in real time , then we might be able to break that wall .

The correct and most boring answer is that we simply have no idea how anything can be \" experienced \" . Sure , we know a bit about neurons , proteins and action potentials in the brain , but we simply have no clue how anything gets into our consciousness . We 're not even able to properly describe what consciousness is . So , even with your eyes open , it 's unknown how we actually \" see \" . We know about light stimulating your retina and subsequently exciting a bunch of brain cells , but experience itself is one of the big mysteries in all of science . The analogy of cameras for eyes is decent . But a camera does not experience sight , it just observes , or records . Our brain does something extra , it experiences our senses , thoughts and feelings . How ? That 's the million dollar question .","Hi , Cognitive Science major here . A simple explanation for vision in the now is the recording or memorization of simulations from the retina that make their way throughout the brain . This firing of the neurons is equivalent to the wiring of the neurons . Like a row of dominoes that you knock down , but after they get knocked down they stand themselves uo again and are more likely to get knocked down in that path again because of the previous sequence of falling dominoes . So what causes memorization of vision for most animals is the external inputs , though uniquely to humans , as far as we know , we can \" re - memorize \" what the environment has already written in to the brain . So your mind 's eye is just the recording of visual memories without the external input . As are any other thoughts . Just with different sensations .","pretend there is a painter that lives in the middle of your brain and is responsible for drawing pictures and then showing you them . Only problem is your eyes are at the other side of a room and he ca n't see out them . So there is a person responsible to look out the window ( eyes ) and then tell the painter what he should paint . Now the painter is really good at his job and the person looking out the window ca n't remember everything about what he sees so some times the painter will be told to draw things without a lot of details such as \" I see a red shinny car on a road with some tree 's in the background \" . In this example the painter will paint tree 's that are close to things he 's drawn before when he was given a lot of details ( in most cases he can say \" I need more details \" and the eyes will focus on the trees ) This is what normal vision is like in the brain and it happens really fast with many images and many eye movements happening every second . Doing this makes the painter really good , after a while of learning how to draw various things he gets quite good at painting stuff without a lot of detail .

It 's better for the environment than coal , but we do n't have a large scale functioning system of waste disposal in place , yet . Again , this is a political issue , not a scientific one . As for renewable , those depend heavily on geographic locations . Hydroelectric is n't as efficient in an area with no streams , wind is inefficient in an area with low winds , and solar is inefficient in Seattle ( get it , because its always overcast and raining there ?

Not a solution as we have pretty much saturated all of the most effective areas for this type of energy production . Yes , we can make it more efficient , but that 's not going to account for a significant enough increase to do anything . Solar : Great source of energy , clean besides waste producing the solar cells . More than enough energy hits the earth to provide for all of our energy needs . However , it is not realistic as a main power source any time soon as there is no good way to store enough energy for when the sun is not shining . This is also expensive for initial start up costs as solar panels are expensive . Solar energy implementation would be best done on a smaller scale , i.e. have each home outfitted with solar panels and provide their own energy instead of having solar farms . This is the only realistic long term ( hundreds of years from now ) solution as even nuclear fuel is limited . Not sure if we even have the materials to make enough solar panels of today 's technology . Biofuels : Good in theory , but not the answer . This is n't a source of energy as you lose energy during this entire process . That alone does n't really mean we should n't pursue this . Liquid fuel is probably something we will always depend on because it has incredibly high energy density ( energy by weight ) . Maybe we can run all our cars on electricity , however , you are n't going to be able to fly a plane without liquid fuels . The only way to get a higher energy density is through nuclear fuel , which is a terrible idea for planes . Going back to biofuels , the process is still expensive , but getting cheaper .

Coal \/ Petroleum : We are going to run out of these soon , maybe not in our lifetime , but within a couple hundred years . Otherwise , its a great source of energy . It 's cheap because its been well established , great energy density , but pretty dirty . Honestly , the health affects of coal are much worse than that of nuclear . In fact , more nuclear waste is produced from a coal plant than a nuclear plant of the same electricity output . The difference of course is that the coal plant waste is more diluted . Nuclear : Controversial because a lot of people do n't really understand how it works . This is a great source of energy and should be the short term ( for next couple hundred years ) solution to our energy needs before we can figure out how to make solar work . Yes , there are safety concerns , however , a lot of these are unfounded . Today 's reactors have passive reactor control systems which means that it is not physically possible to have them meltdown . The primary concern is what to do with the waste , but honestly you can dig a hole , seal it up , and it would n't leach out for a hundred thousand years ( apparently that was n't good enough ) . Nuclear , unlike solar , can provide a consistent energy production . Furthermore , you can use nuclear for a lot of other things such as desalination of water and production of liquid fuels .

How is it not caught every time ..","Cocaine is made from coca leaves . Opiates ( such as heroin ) are made from opium resin , from the sap of poppy flowers . Coca is a bushy plant that is native to South America , and grown mostly there . ( Coca is not to be confused with cacao , which is the plant that chocolate comes from . ) Poppies are a flower that is native to the Mediterranean region , but is today most heavily grown in central and southern Asia . Poppy flowers that you can buy at garden shops are actually the same species as \" opium poppies \" , and they do contain opiates . It 's legal to grow them for decorative purposes , but not to extract opium from them . ( The bright orange \" California poppy \" does not contain opium . ) Similarly , poppy seeds that are used in pastries do contain a tiny amount of opiates . It 's a myth that eating one poppyseed bagel will make you test positive for opiates on a drug test . However , some European pastries are stuffed with poppyseed - based filling and will certainly register on a urine test . A blood test can tell the difference between heroin ( or fentanyl ) and poppyseeds , though . ( Historically , poppy seeds were a byproduct of opium production . Opium has been used as a medicine for pain since the dawn of recorded history in Europe . There are sculptures from Minoan Crete depicting the poppy as a goddess of healing . By the way , cannabis is from the Caucasus , and the Greek historian Herodotus was kind of weirded out by how the people there \u2014 the Scythians \u2014 used it : they would burn it in bonfires to get high on the smoke . ) Anyway , these plants are grown secretly , or with the cooperation ( bribery ) of local governments . Extracting cocaine from coca leaves , or crude opium from poppies , does n't have to be much more complicated than extracting caffeine from coffee beans or tea leaves . But for the drug trade , it 's done with chemicals to make it faster and more efficient . Turning opium into heroin is a bunch more complicated and involves secret chemical labs . Opium is ancient , but heroin was only invented in the 20th century . Extracting opium from poppies involves letting the flower go to seed , and then scratching or cutting the seed - pod to make it ooze sap . The sap contains a mixture of many different chemicals , some of which are already drugs ( primarily morphine ) and others that can be chemically changed to make drugs . Extracting cocaine from coca leaves involves soaking them in water and chemicals to get the cocaine to dissolve out of the leaves . It 's worth noting that coca leaves and poppy extracts can be used as drugs without any further preparation . Native people in Colombia , Bolivia , and Peru have chewed coca leaves as a mild stimulant for thousands of years . The ancient Greeks and Persians used opium extracted from poppies with alcohol from wine . However , coca leaves and poppy pods are very bulky ; refined cocaine and heroin are much more compact and therefore easier to smuggle . There is a general rule that when drugs are made illegal , people find ways to make the drugs stronger , because stronger drugs are easier to smuggle . In the 1920s , when the U.S. prohibited alcohol , the production of beer and wine basically shut down , but gin and whiskey became more popular . Cocaine is stronger than coca leaves , and crack is stronger again than cocaine . Modern cannabis is much stronger than the \" Indian hemp \" that has been grown for thousands of years . Some of the opiates used today , such as carfentanil , are so much stronger than plain opium that they were originally invented not even as painkillers , but to be used in tranquilizer darts on elephants !"],"4209":["To put it super simply ; seizures are when neurons in your brain get hyperexcited and start firing off ( and often different pathways nearby that should n't be activated get excited too ) . Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant . When you chronically drink alcohol , it increases the activation \/ release of GABA , which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter . Again , in simple terms this just depresses the function of pathways and makes it harder for neurons to fire off . After a while , your body gets used to operating under such high levels of inhibition from all the GABA released from drinking alcohol . This manifests in the form of neurons becoming super - sensitive to any signal that 's going to excite them . So on the one hand you have them being depressed by GABA , and on the other you have them being hypersensitive to whatever activates them . This balances out to basically normal function . When you finally stop drinking , suddenly you 're no longer getting that excessive GABA release and so they 're not being inhibited \/ depressed any.ore . * But * , the neurons are still hypersensitive to activation signals . So they 're hyperexcitable ; stopping alcohol takes the brakes off them and they get activated super easily and fire off leading to the seizures seen early in severe alcohol withdrawal ( delirium tremens ) until those neurons get used to not being inhibited and return to normal levels of excitability . Again , this is kinda simplified . GABA depresses function by majorly inhibiting neurotransmitters that * excite * neurons and promote signalling ( stuff like noradrenaline , glutamate , and dopamine ) . It also blocks the NMDA receptor which is responsible for mediating the excitatory effects of glutamate . In response , your body increases the amount of NMDA receptors a neuron expresses , so it 's more sensitive to glutamate and more likely to get excited ( to combat the depressive GABA effects and get back to some degree of normal function while the person is still drinking ) . This is that hyperexcitable state I was talking about . Then the person stops drinking and suddenly you have a buttload of excitatory noradrenaline \/ glutamate release ( because they 're no longer inhibited by GABA ) * and * you have neurons which are absolutely covered in receptors to bind and get activated by all that noradrenaline \/ glutamate . The result is neurons firing off rapidly and uncontrollably leading to seizures .","Alcohol works on receptors in the brain . The more you drink the more receptors get activated . In alcoholics that drink a large amount of alcohol consistently over time , the number of receptors increases . That s what builds tolerance . If someome has a bunch of receptors they have to drink enough to activate them all and feel drunk . When an alcoholic drinks a lot everyday those receptors are used to being acticated and it becomes a necessity . When that necessity is nt met , i.e. someone gets sober , those receptors freak out and the reaction is sweats , tremors , withdrawals , etc .","Its a severe rebound effect .

Examples of vector - borne diseases are malaria which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and Lyme disease , which is transmitted to humans by ticks .","A vector is a quantity that defines both magnitude and direction . It can be visually shown as an arrow in 2D or 3D , or quantitatively as 2 or 3 numbers . For example , if you are looking down to the ground from high up you see 2 cars . One is moving east at 20 m \/ s and the other is moving north - west at 30 m \/ s. a vector in this situation can be described as an arrow in 2D. For the first car , it 's speed is a vector with magnitude 20 and direction to the right . For the second car , it 's speed is a vector with magnitude 30 and direction up - left . The arrow for the second car will be longer than the first because its magnitude is higher . In short , a vector is an arrow describing some quantity of an object with its magnitude as the length of the arrow , and the direction as the direction of the arrow . Vectors are very important in physics and multivariable calculus ."],"3905":["A kind of numbness occurs , a sense of something being wrong , immediately .

It 's not a legal requirement , but a cultural assumption that you tip . A waiter 's salary is given under that assumption . It can be extremely confusing and even a little off - putting for foreigners from countries where tipping is not the norm . There 's also a confusing taboo about it where you 're not really supposed to talk about the size of your tip . This particularly can be horribly confusing for foreigners because tipping can vary depending on the type of service . What if several different people were servicing you ? Who do you ask ? I highly recommend Googling the norms prior to going . Haircuts , restaurants , taxies ... whatever really . Source : A Dane living in the US for 3 years .","Tipping is * customary * , but * * not * * a legal requirement . Federal minimum wage is $ 7.25 , while Federal minimum wage for * tipped staff * is $ 2.13 . A tip is part \" thank you \" , part \" service fee \" . The theory of tipping accomplishes two things : 1 . Because tips are an employee 's livelihood , there is a greater incentive to provide * better * service to the customer . The better the service , the more money the employee earns . 2 . Much of the cost of employment is passed to the customer , which means the restaurant can spend money elsewhere . Perhaps better ingredients , better chefs , better atmosphere , etc . If a tipped employee does * not * meet the $ 7.25 mark after tips , the employer is required by law to make up the difference . However , this * rarely * happens because if a tipped employee is n't pulling their weight , they 're to be fired . You do not tip when getting take - away or if you order food at the counter . You * only * tip if you receive wait service . 15 % for adequate service . 18 % for good service . Anything over 18 % is considered a high tip . You should understand that tips are often pooled and shared among house - staff . This includes dishwashers and busboys . Even if you receive bad service - refusing to leave a tip is an insult to * all employees * and considered a major faux pas . It 's customary to tip bartenders , usually $ 1 per drink . It 's customary to tip for valet parking , even if service is complementary . Usually $ 2 . If a bellhop helps you with your bags to your room , its customary to tip about $ 1 per bag . It 's customary to tip for * some other services * that are not \" tipped \" employees under federal guidelines . For example , taxi drivers and tattoo artists .

Firstly , the game needs to be popular . eSports can only exist if there are a lot of people willing to watch other people play . Hearthstone got extremely popular very quickly because of a few different reasons . The game is made by Blizzard which automatically means there are tons of people willing to try it . The game was also promoted heavily by streamers from other games . Many Starcraft , Dota , League , etc streamers tried it out when it was in beta , and that got the attention of a LOT of people . It 's also really easy to get into since it 's free to play and relatively easy for casual players to enjoy . Secondly , there needs to be a high enough skill ceiling for good players to distinguish themselves . In Hearthstone , this comes in the form of deck building taking a pretty good understanding of the game , and in being able to quickly ( within 90 seconds ) determine what the correct play is when you 're presented with several options . Deck building in Hearthstone ( and most card games ) takes knowing all of the cards and how they interact , knowing what decks * other * people are playing so that you can counter them , and having the creativity or insight to know how to put together new decks that other people do n't know how to counter yet . And lastly , the game simply has to be fun to watch . I 've seen plenty of games that had plenty of players and had a high skill cap , but simply was n't fun to watch . That 's one of the reasons I never enjoyed watching , for example , competitive WoW PvP. It simply was n't terribly exciting most of the time . If you have a specific example of a game that you think should be an eSport , I 'd love to hear it so I can give my opinion .","There is only really one deciding factor in whether a game becomes an e - sport with huge events . The game needs a company who is willing to invest money into making it happen . Now these companies can be gaming companies or it can be companies which make a living hosting big e - sport events , which means a game typically needs popularity before anyone wants to invest into it , but it really all comes down to money . I 'll use World of Tanks as an example as it 's a game that went from having no form of e - sporting events , to having the biggest as well as the biggest prices . It did n't happen because people suddenly decided it was fun to watch World of Tanks matches , no , it happened because Wargaming ( the company who owns World of Tanks ) decided they wanted the game to be an e - sport , and it just so happened they were rich enough to make it so . World of Tanks is more of a Russian thing , but if you look at which games are popular on twitch TV as an example , you 'll quickly notice it 's games which were designed from the bottom up to be e - sport games by companies who 're currently also investing a lot of money into tournaments . Nintendo does n't do that , and since super smash bros have n't really attracted anyone with a media platform to earn money on streaming it , it 's tournaments are monetized .","Some of the biggest Esports games are that of MOBAs .

The most detailed character information is from the graphic novels . In the novels , his back story is that he is born within one of the worst prisons in the world , somewhere in South America , and is made to serve out the remainder of his dead father 's life sentence . Throughout the time he was imprisoned in this hellhole , he develops on his natural abilities : he becomes extremely intelligent , reading eveything he finds , and gets hench and becomes awesome at fighting . Notably , throughout his time in prison his dreams get plagued by an image of a bat . After becoming essentially the ' badass ' of this prison , he gets chosen to become a test subject for an experimental drug called ' Venom ' . Once taken , Bane becomes insanely strong and powerful , but has to take it every twelve hours or he suffers from intense withdrawal effects . In the Knightfall storyline ( which TDKR is loosely based on ) , he escapes the prison and heads to Gotham City . He does this because he wants to destroy Batman - he is fascinated by him because like in prison , Gotham is ruled by fear , only it is fear of Batman and not Bane . He also believes Batman is a bat from his nightmares and believes it is fate that he must fight Batman . He then breaks open Arkham Asylum , unleashing all the supervillains , and Batman is forced to run himself ragged trying to capture them all . When Batman is on his last legs , Bane emerges , breaks his back , and essentially takes over Gotham City . Oh yeah , and Bane works out Batman = Bruce Wayne before they battle . Now in the movie TDKR , they change it around a bit . Bane 's mask supplies him with anesthetic rather than venom ( presumably to make the film more ' realistic ' ) . His motivation is different also ; it is revealed that he was actually Talia Al - Ghul 's accomplice and his whole scheme was actually part of the League of Shadows .

Bane is all about the limits of justice , and exposes how it has become fatuous and self - referential .

Power plants send away electricity on demand . The thing is this : You can imagine electricity to be like water . As long as you have no need for water , you just clog the end of the pipe . In our electrical case : There is nothing running inside your house that uses energy . Now you need water , so you place the end of the pipe inside let 's say your bathtub and unclog it . At that moment your water supplier has to send water through the pipe to keep it full . He will let water flow in until you clog your pipe again . And that 's what power plants do , too . The power lines are always energized and ready to send charge into whatever you plug into your power outlet , but as long as there is nothing to take the charge , the power plant does n't refill them , so they do n't have to send any power into the grid . Now there is actually unused energy . Since you do n't have to send a message to the power plant whenever you want to turn on your computer , they always have to have a potential of offering more energy than is used right now . They already provide the energy your fridge and your lamps need , but now you turn on your TV and need the energy * immediately * , so the power plant must have that at hand , too . As a result they have to get rid of that surplus on energy as long as it is not used . This often is done by just producing steam and letting the steam out into the open . Other plants have resources to save the energy , for example by liquidizing salt or pumping water into lakes on a hill . This energy can later be returned into electrical energy , when the demand is high .","It is broadly the case that the grid is designed so that the exact amount of electricity being used is being generated . This is orchestrated using sophisticated scheduling , adjustment mechanisms , and a ~1 % reserve of power plants ( and increasingly loads ) that can respond quickly . But at the shortest timescales , like hundredths of a second , there is always a bit of an an imbalance , either too much or too little . When there is excess generation , the extra energy pushes up against the inertia of all the spinning generators and turbines ( and motors and other physical loads ) . This spinning equipment immediately absorbs the energy and starts spinning faster , in which case the frequency starts to go up a little bit . The grid operator will notice this and send a signal to that 1 % reserve fleet to send less steam \/ fuel into their turbines ( or in the case of hydro storage , pump water into the resevoir , or in the case of emerging battery storage technology , pull power off the grid by charging the battery or spinning up the flywheel ) . This takes a second or two to kick in , so the frequency is allowed to vary a tiny bit . There are also capacitors all over the place . These are used for reactive power correction , but they probably interact in this process as well . Someone smarter than me would have to comment on that .","I 'm no expert , but here is several stuff that I have heard over the years . I assume some of it is probably true . Nuclear power plants are very sensitive to energy overproduction . If the connection to the grid fails a nuclear disaster could happen . That 's why they have a giant resistor as a safety device . In case of an emergency the energy is used to produce a lot of heat ( that is not used in any productive way ) until the reactor can shut down . Generally unused energy is stored for later use . There are storage facilities that are based on rechargeable batteries . These are of course very expensive , but they are great if there are problems with the frequency \/ synchronization of the sine wave the AC is delivered in . Other more economical systems just pump water from a lower basin to a higher basin and when energy is needed , the water pressure is used to produce extra energy . Of course the main strategy is to produce just the right amount of energy . * * tl;dr :* * Extra energy is not produced or it is stored or in emergencies it is wasted ."],"7452":["Not necessarily .

CGI - animated films such as Pixar 's have a long and expensive process . First off , a bunch of different artists have to draw really complex models for the movie 's characters , which allow the animators to give them natural movement . Then comes the long step of drawing all the different details and textures on each character , which in itself can seem like a torture to an outsider . For example , remember how fuzzy and hairy Sully was in ' Monsters Inc. ' ? Watch that movie again and pay attention to the details . You 'll notice that , with each of Sully 's moves , his hair moves and floats accordingly . Well , some poor souls who probably have gone mad by now had to not only draw all thousands of Sully 's hairs , but give each one of them movement so it all looked natural on - screen . Making a character 's jaw move in coordination with their dialogue and all different stuff that animation requires in order to look natural are also expensive . Once all of the characters , their moves , the scene 's backgrounds , SFX and all that stuff are created , they still have to be rendered by a computer , frame by frame . What animators and artists really do is create instructions so that another computer can render the results , sort of like if you wrote a thousand words on paper and handed it to someone who draws you and image . Each second on a film consists of 24 frames , so an hour - an - a - half movie ends up taking about 130,000 frames , all of which have to be rendered by lots of computers in enormous rooms . 3D films work by constantly blinding you on one eye and then the other to create the illusion of depth , requiring two overlapped frames on film . Live action movies are filmed by setting two cameras side by side , which also increases production costs . Well , 3D CGI - animated films are the same , so now each second needs 48 frames to be rendered .

Secondly , here 's a quick run through of the general process : 1 . The Wort is produced by mixing a starch source ( most often malted and crushed grains \/ barley a.k.a malts ) with hot water , this step is known as Mashing . This process takes a few hours , and causes the starches to break down into sugars . 2 . The Wort is drained from the malts , and the malts rinsed to remove as much of the sweet wort as possible . The sweet Wort and associated washings are trasnfered into a kettle ( known as a copper ) , and boiled for a few hours . This boils off some of the water , and produces a more concentrated Wort , allowing for a more efficient fermentation later on . The boiling also kills off any remaining enzymes \/ bacteria in the Wort , effectively sterylizing it . During the boil , hops are pitched into the Wort to add a bitter flavour . The longer the hops are boiled , the more bitter the final brew will be , but the less light - hoppy aroma you get on the palate . Careful selection of hop variety , as well as knowing when to pitch the hops is essential in producing the champion brews ! 3 . After the Wort is boiled , it 's cooled ready for the yeast . If the wort stays too hot it 'll kill the yeast , and you wo n't get any beer . Some breweries may hop the wort at this late stage , to give a powerfully hoppy aroma to the final brew . The hopped and cooled Wort is transfered to the fermenter , where the yeast is then pitched . During fermentation , the yeast digests the sugars in the Wort , producing ethanol ( alcohol - gets you drunk ) and carbon dioxide ( makes it gassy \/ fizzy ) . The fermentation step can take anywhere from days to months , depending on the brew .. but this long period allows any particulate matter to settle out to the bottom of the fermenter , resulting in a clear beer . 4 . Once the fermentation has finished , the final beer product is bottled \/ canned \/ casked . Then either stored on racks to mature , or sold and enjoyed straight away ! The different types of beers are usually achieved by the types of grains \/ hops used , as well as the stage in which the hops are pitched , how many hoppings are carried out etc .. sometimes the beer undergoes a few fermentations too ..

It was beneficial to discourage recreational sex , and shame is a good way achieve that . Nowadays sex is mostly safe , but society is slow to change and so those shameful attitudes still exist .","The short answer is STDs , once STDs become a major public health challenge then sexual activity must be curtailed and the use of shame is one of the best ways to control this . The best examples of this are isolated tribal people such Polynesian islanders . Until European sailors arrived they had a very open and accepting attitude to sexual activity . Once the STDs spread then that stopped . The second part is societies based on property and inheritance of that property . If you were going to spend many years raising a child then pass on your accumulated wealth then you want to be sure that it is your genetic off spring that is receiving this bounty . Hence the need for monogamous relationships , or the need for one brother to take care of the widow of a dead sibling . Untill the advent of birth control it became increasingly expensive to raise children , so stable families were required , as single women would struggle to meet the costs . It gets real interesting if you look at early medieval civilizations as they swarmed across Europe , the Saxons and later the Vikings practiced a from of genocide in conquered territory , all existing men and male children would be slaughtered , he women became chattel slaves but the offspring were considered the sons of the conquerors and could inherit . So another answer to you question might be that it helps to establish the patriarchy .","Because of the combination of big brains and walking upright , human babies are born quite immature compared to other animals ( e.g. puppies or kittens are walking in weeks and self - sufficient in months , but these things take multiple years for human babies ) . So human babies require a lot of resources to be invested , usually by the parents , since ( in biology terms of being able to propagate genes ) the parents of a child directly benefit from the child 's survival and prosperity . Each sex benefits from having a monogamous mate : If you 're male , the benefits of having a monogamous female are that the children you spend resources to raise are genetically yours . If you 're female , the benefits of having a monogamous male are that the male will continue to contribute his full resources to help you and your children during the pregnancy and long childhood . You do n't want him to divert some or all of his resources to another female and half - siblings of your children that carry his genes but not yours . Both sexes also have benefit from cheating and not being monogamous . If you 're male , cheating gives you extra children , more genetic diversity and more chances to spread your genes . If you 're female , cheating gives you more genetic diversity , allows you to take resources from multiple males , or \" trade up \" to a better provider if your current mate does n't have as many resources as some other male who 's attracted to you . So because of biology , it 's in a situation where everyone wants others to \" play by the rules \" while they have an incentive to cheat . It 's similar to the situation with property rights -- you want others to respect your own property rights , but you can gain private benefit if you ignore others ' property rights and steal their food and tools when they 're not paying attention . Sociologists and game theorists say that when such a situation happens , human societies will develop enforcement mechanisms to encourage everyone to \" play by the rules . \" Enforcement includes direct punishments ( adulterers are stoned , thieves go to jail ) and social norms ( do n't steal because it 's wrong , do n't have sex outside of approved monogamous relationships because it 's wrong ) . The feeling of shame is basically an emotion to help people live together in societies , by making you feel bad when you do something that would cause your society to reject you . There are a few other reasons , too . Of course normally wired humans are going to have sexual urges , and because of the social norms described above , they 're going to feel shame . The thing about shame is it makes you feel bad when you * might * be rejected by your society -- so one way you can get yourself to feel better is to convince some authority figure in your society that the society should overlook the thing that caused you to feel shame , and continue to accept you as a member . So that 's another reason why many religions emphasize that sexual urges should lead to shame -- because if people feel that shame , they will then turn to the priesthood for confession and absolution ( basically convincing the authority figure -- the priest -- that your society should continue to accept you despite your shameful sexual urges ) . It increases the religion 's power and influence if they 're the sole providers of a product that everyone needs . In this case , the product is a way for priests to relieve the feeling of shame that the priesthood itself has encouraged people to feel . In Catholicism you literally tell the priest \" This is how I am impure , forgive me Father \" and the priest says \" You are forgiven if you increase your devotion to the church by saying X prayers . \" In Protestantism it 's a more personal , inner dialog between yourself and Jesus \/ God , rather than a conversation with a priest , but it 's the same idea of \" I feel shame because I 've done something my society disapproves of , and I feel better because I 'm forgiven directly in this inner dialog with Jesus , the top authority figure of all Christianity . \" To address the last part of your question , I do n't know where you got the notion that societies do n't associate other things with shame . Think of the Ten Commandments in ancient times , or the Seven Deadly Sins in the Middle Ages . Murder and stealing are two things which are still uncontroversially wrong , and people are expected to feel shame . I can think of at least two of the Seven Deadly Sins that are non - sexual , and still expected to engender shame in 21st century America : - Greed : I suspect part of the reason some rich people contribute to charitable causes is trying to buy social approval for their pursuit of wealth -- arguably , the existence of philanthropy is evidence that our society associates the non - sexual feel - good phenomenon of greed with shame . - Gluttony : Everything from widespread practical concerns about the health consequences of obesity , to the prevalence of full - blown eating disorders and serious body - image issues , says that modern society relates the non - sexual feel - good activity of high - calorie food consumption to a feeling of shame .

First it would require intimate knowledge of the hardware - which AMD \/ Nvidia would not want to publicly release - and second , it would be so time consuming that they would spend all of their resources on that . So AMD and Nvidia create drivers since they have intimate knowledge of all of their hardware . The drivers address the GPU hardware at the lowest level , implementing an API ( Application Program Interface ) standard such as DirectX , OpenGL , or Vulkan . So now a game developer instead of writing their game and directly telling the GPU hardware what to do , it uses API calls . The benefit of this is that they now no longer have to care what hardware is running on the PC , because all of the hardware conforms to an API standard . Imagine being at a restaurant and ordering a burger . Would you yourself go into the kitchen and direct the cooks on exactly how to cook it ? If everyone did that it would be a time - consuming disaster , with inconsistent results . Instead we go through an intermediary - your server ( analogy for API ) . You tell your server you want a burger , and they go to the kitchen and tell them to make a burger . No matter how many times someone orders a burger this way , the results are consistent and predictable .

There a 100 or so base pairs ( steps in a twisted ladder ) that are lost every time DNA is replicated and the cell to which those copies go to splits . Over time , the loss of base pairs in replication will eventually hit coding DNA ( the important parts in your DNA ) and since the coding parts of the DNA are now not functional because you lost 100 or so base pairs in the dna chain , then you age . For dogs , this happens at a substantially greater rate , causing them to age a lot faster that humans . The opposite is true for parrots and some turtles . They actually have non - coding sections in their DNA that act as protection against the loss of important base pairs . These sections of Non - coding dna are called telomeres . These telomeres prevent DNA from aging until they are used up , or until they are n't made anymore . Humans have telomeres in their DNA until roughly the age of 2 , which means essentially we have the possibility of not aging and living forever until we are roughly two years old . For dogs , I 'm guessing their telomeres either are used up earlier , or they just do n't exist for a dog .","Okay , I put up some criticism , but noone put up good explanation , so I 'm taking the plunge . As to do with most questions about biology that seem puzzling at first , the answer has to do with evolution and evolutionary equilibrium . * * TL \/ DR : Animal life - spans are determined by evolution selecting for the shortest possible life - span that allows the animal species to proliferate . For humans , it is longer than for other animals because tribes of ancient humans benefited from transmission of knowledge , cultures , customs and inter - tribe connections from older and wiser to younger members , thus aiding their survival and spread * * But before getting into that more , let me say that details on why some animals age faster than others in terms of how some mechanisms work at a cellular or genetic level is actually missing the point . Why ? because if there was strong enough evolutionary pressure , the animals would over generations change their body chemistry so they age slower . But they do nt . Why ? That s the real question here . So think of it in the extreme form like for Salmon . Most fish do n't just suddenly age and die . But salmon do . Even those that reach the breeding grounds upstream in great condition . Why ? Mostly because evolution selected for salmon that spent very little energy trying to maintain their bodies , and all of it in swimming upstream faster \/ sooner and mating vigorously . What happens after they mate was not an evolutionary concern . When you have a complex system and you do nt maintain it , it fails . It fails rapidly everywhere . Death ensues . So aging is a similar issue . Natural selection for all plant \/ animal species has picked out close to the optimum life span that an individual organism is worth preserving for to ensure its long term survival and proliferation . This answers many things . Lets start thinking this way : * * Extended details for those interested ... * * - What would happen if some animals were immortal ? Well , * * an immortal species would go EXTINCT ! * * . This is because over time the environment and other animals around change , so what was the most well adapted species is no longer competitive anymore . They would soon all be killed by predators or climate or even more importantly by disease . ( And I emphasize disease because disease is caused by microbes which are very small and live and die and evolve most rapidly , so they are the hardest to keep up with ) . - So clearly living long is n't really that good . Evolution is biased towards quicker living and quicker dying species so it can evolve the fastest . So any additional years you keep an organism alive HAS to come with signficant benefits . Not for that animal itself ( evolution could n't care about any particular individual ) , but for the survival of the population as a whole . - So over time , animal species tend to acquire life - spans that are optimal based on their environment ( including how fast it changes , how the animal lives , what its predators are , how much food children need to grow , how much the seasons change etc ) . So this is really why things are the way they are : - Evolutionary optimization means the optimal life span for larger animals is longer than that for smaller animals because they need time to grow to their full size , and that is limited , among many other things , by food availability . So this creates a generally applicable correlation where bigger animals usually live longer . Further , needing to provide lots of food to produce and rear a big baby means you can only have so many babies at once , this means to maintain population a big animal usually has to keep having babies for many years , which again means it has to live longer . - Animals that can only raise a few offspring at a time , and only on good years , clearly need to live long otherwise they would soon go extinct . Examples include humans , penguins , many birds and predators , large animals and so on . - Animals with few natural predators tend to have longer lifespans than those with many predators . Not just life - expectancy , but life - span ! Why ? because if chances are you will be eaten up before seeing too many seasons , it is more efficient to spend all the energy trying to have as many offspring as quickly as possible instead of the body spending some energy keeping it strong and healthy . So eventually the species evolves to breed earlier and quicker and let the body age and die sooner . - Animals usually settled in faster changing environments have shorter lifetimes than animals in slower changing environments . Clearly how big the effect is depends on the scale of change . But for instance the it is part of the reason some tropical forest species like macaws live so long because their habitat and their niche has been stable for long periods of time ( The other and just as important reasons include having fewer predators , their being intelligent social species with adult learning , the optimality of raising few chicks at a time and so forth ) . Same with many deep sea species like deep sea sharks , squid , octopus and other deep sea fish . - Similarly , animals that use learned intelligence to help their survival generally live longer than other . They just need time to pick up all the skills from their parents or colony . And having to spend time teaching a kid limits the number of offspring an individual can have , thus making them have to live longer for the species to survive . - * * So finally * * , it makes sense why humans live that long . They are relatively large . Their weak babies need a lot of care while they are young so they ca nt have too many at once . They need to teach their kids many skills and keep feeding them as they grow up so extra effort is required . This explains why human menopause is so late ( around 40 , almost the lifespan of most animals ) . * * Further * * , since humans are social species at an inter - tribal level as well , it turns out having older adults even past menopause helps to preserve and transmit the acquired knowledge from a far , of environments that were different , of networks and connections with far and away tribes and so forth . So evolution selected for tribes where even non - reproducing old adults survived and lived to old age . And as bonus , it turns out in tight social groups like those of humans , grandparents can help in rearing the grandkids and keeping them alive so the parents can have more children . And there is nothing evolution loves more than animal populations that can have more kids and keep them alive . - And finally , coming down to a lower level , since evolution selected for these , the right sets of genes , traits , and even instincts and culture was selected to make this happen at a cellular and genetic level . For animals where shorter lifespans were optimal , biochemical systems that were more efficient and less conducive to long term maintenance were chosen . If there were any potential problems , mutations etc that would cause early death in animals with longer optimal lifespans , they were rooted out in selecting the longer living individuals . For species with shorter optimal lifespan , they were not . Either way , for each species , by the time the optimal lifespan rolls around , the lack of maintenance , the wear and tear , the piles of un - resolved genetic errors and damaging interactions become overwhelming , and the body and organs deteriorate , start showing breakdown and eventually become unable to support life , the process which we call aging and death . - Bonus : so what are these * things * that pile up that we are talking about ? things like cancerous gene networks . Inadequate clearing of arteries leading to cardiovascular problems . Inadequate replacement of organ cells leading to organ failure . Inadequate maintenance of bones and muscles leading to arthritis and muscle atrophy . Non - existent methods to rid the body of accumulated toxins , scarring damage , etc causing the aged appearance , the lost elasticity of skin , wrinkling , weak ligaments and muscles etc . So yeah , death becomes sort of inevitable and hard to cure when you think about it this way . Aging is a bitch . In particular because it a thousand bitches all bitching with the same goal . And after understanding that , it also suddenly makes sense why preventing aging and death is sooo hard . It is because there 's no one system that breaks . It is like trying to keep a machine made out of millions of biodegradable parts each of which have a lifetime of a month , going for a year . Over time , everything will break down and literally fall apart . From inside out and outside in . From the molecular , cellular , to the systems level . Indeed , many believe humans will just take to living as robots far before we learn to substantially extend our lifespans , not least because the level or technology that would enable us to fix aging , will likely also allow us to create artificial robotic bodies that are far more capable , comfortable , upgradeable , and customizable than our biological bodies ever will be !","Same reason you hear dog years and cat years . They age faster . A dog is 7 years because they age 7 times as fast .

Things like the mandelbrot set are a bit more complex . While you can simply plot which coordinates are in or are not in the mandelbrot set , people like to get a bit more creative and add color schemes base on how far in or how far out that coordinate is in the mandelbrot set .","There are several ways mathematics can be used to produce images . The Mandelbrot set is an example of an * escape -time fractal * . The x , y plane can naturally be identified with the complex numbers ; ( x , y ) corresponds to the complex number x+iy . Now you can specify rules for producing a sequence of numbers , given a starting number . You could have f(z ) = z^2 + c where c is some fixed complex number you are free to choose . Now you can choose a z , and compute the sequence 0 , f(0 ) , f(f(0 ) ) , f(f(f(0 ) ) ) , etc . Some sequences * converge * . This means the sequences numbers are forever getting \" closer \" to some fixed number , called the * limit * of the sequence . A good example is f(x ) = 1 \/ x.

Go back to f(z ) = z^2 + c. Let 's always start from 0 . For which values of c will the sequence converge , and for which will it not converge ? This is the mandelbrot set . In any image , there will be the funky - shaped black region . The points which are black and make up this shape correspond to the complex numbers for which the sequence converges . What about the fancy colours ? They are a measure of how non - convergent the other numbers are . When generating the graphics , the computer will count how many steps sequence takes until the value is \" too big , so the sequence will not converge \" ( this is where the name escape - time comes from ) , and that number is used to choose a colour .","There is n't just one way to do it , but ultimately , they are all equivalent .

It 's possible ( and likely ) that those mental changes are evolutionarily based . When you 're young and growing , your body is going to need certain nutrients more than others . This is why pregnancy changes a lot of women 's dietary habits so drastically ( though that 's a hormonal change which is causing them to crave certain foods ) .

In an emergency , it 's a lot easier to get 3 - 4 people out of a car when they 're buckled , but much harder to get 60 children out of a bus when they 're buckled . Not to mention that kids are little shits , so they 'll hit each other with buckles and the driver ca n't really guarantee that they 're buckled in the first place . ( Edit - Actually , they can guarantee it in the first place , i.e. before they start driving , but they 've got no way of guaranteeing that the kids wo n't just unbuckle as soon as the bus starts moving ) School buses are a pretty safe form of transportation since most other drivers are unlikely to mess with them , and due to their size they are less likely to tip over . URL_0","Well , most of these answers are tangential to the true reason , in the US at least . That reason is cost . Remember buses are bought with tax dollars from lowest bidders , and for some reason we as a society are more willing to spend billions on weapon systems even the Pentagon says we do not need than a few extra thousand per bus to protect our children . Practically all school bus manufacturers offer ( or are prepared to offer if a market develops ) seat belts as alternative equipment . But because almost all schools are government funded , and ALL schools buy buses by bid , lowest bid wins . So if I work for , say , Blue Bird and I bid on 2000 school buses for the Metropolis Unified District of Schools ( MUDS ) , I am bidding against - for example - Thomas Built Buses and Starcraft . If the MUDS specs do n't include seat belts - and unless they are required by federal , state or local law ( hint : they 're not ) they do n't - then I can not include them in my bid if I want to be competitive . So why are they not legally required ? A large number of reasons , some dealing with school bus manufacture - ever wonder why school buses sit so high ? Not , as one might think for driver line of sight ( a great side benefit ) but so that in a collision with passenger vehicles the force of collision is below the center of mass of the bus reducing the likelihood of tipping^1 - and some dealing with , as mentioned above , cost . Every time there is an accident ( most of which are investigated by the NTSB , BTW ) there is a hue and cry for more safety measures in buses . The problem is the crashes happen in October and February , and buses are ( mostly ) purchased in June and July ( end of\/ beginning of budget year for most school districts ) . By then poor Johnny has been forgotten but the laser attention to line item budget details is at maximum focus . So , no seat belts .

He has been interviewed for TV several times and even called to testify in court trials abut this subject . ^1 - A pet peeve of mine : buses seldom , indeed almost never ' roll over ' . They can tip onto their side but - due to their design and low travel speeds - on relatively level ground they usually will not ' roll over ' .

A person with can be biologically male ( sex ) , but they can identify as female ( gender ) . Of course the statement \" i am male \/ female \" can then be controversial , politically speaking and even ambiguous since you do n't know which is being referred to .","Sex is assigned at birth . The doctor looks at the genitalia and writes \" male \" or \" female \" on the birth certificate . Usually it 's a clear distinction , but there are people who are born intersex whose genitalia are not male or female , and it 's up to the doctor 's judgment to pick one . We learn in biology class that male is XY and female is XX , but there are also genetic abnormalities where someone can be X ( Turner syndrome ) or XXY ( Kleinfelter syndrome ) , so even that distinction is blurry . Of course , in 99 % of cases , sex is easy to determine , but I feel like this is worth mentioning . It 's difficult to come up with an objective definition of sex , basically . Gender is how a person feels and\/or chooses to represent themselves to the outside world . In the vast majority of cases , gender and sex are the same thing , which is why historically the terms have been used entirely interchangeably . Someone who feels that they are a woman but was assigned \" male \" at birth is transgendered , as is a person who was assigned female at birth but feels that they are a man . Transsexual is used somewhat interchangeably , but it 's sometimes used to describe someone who has undergone surgery to alter their genitalia whereas \" transgender \" does not necessarily mean that they 've had surgery . A transvestite is someone who identifies as one gender but dresses like the opposite gender , like a drag queen . Someone who is transgender is not a transvestite , they 're very different things . RuPaul is a man in both sex and gender , he just likes to dress up like a woman . There are also people who feel that gender is more complicated than \" you 're a man or woman . \" Gender - queer , agender , gender - fluid , androgynous , that stuff . They all mean different things , but none of them are \" male \" or \" female . \" edit : I should also mention that if you accidentally refer to a transgender person as a \" transvestite , \" they 'll be really offended . \" Transvestite \" says \" you are a man that likes to dress up as a girl , \" so it will really piss someone off if they feel that they genuinely are a girl . second edit : I should add that textbooks generally define sex in terms of which role an individual plays in reproduction . In mammals and reptiles , for example , the female receives genetic material from the male and gives birth to offspring ( either as an egg or as live young ) . The problem with defining it that way is that it does n't really leave room to define the sex of individuals that are sterile at birth , nor does it clearly define any sort of * permanence * since there are a number of hermaphroditic species .","[ This is a good infographic ] ( URL_0 )"],"8904":["[ If you want a detailed PDF about the process . ] ( URL_0 ) The * * TL;DR * * of it is that is where the air escapes from vents in the tire mold .

Used to work in visual neuroscience , and this is my best guess . I 'd love if someone has a definite answer though ! I think the main culprit is visual glare . Light travels in straight lines , but you get glare when light is scattered in a disorganised pattern \\(usually strong light , like car headlights in rain\\ ) . Your brain has to process everything you see , and its less work if you can see everything clearly . If you have to perceive an indistinct shape , your higher visual processing areas have to work harder . Glare from bright light will make it harder to perceive things around you . So what I think might be going on is that glare \\(which again is disorganised , scattered light\\ ) means that you 're perceiving a different pattern of scattered light from each eye . Your brain has to interpret and combine both images , which is a lot of work \\(this is normally easy because they 're usually the same\\ ) . Shutting off one eye \\(half the signal\\ ) means you have less work to do , and might make it easier to see . Either that or its something really simple that I 've missed , like shutting one eye makes it easier to decrease the pupil size in your open eye !","Your brain is basically just concerned about how much light your eyes are taking in . If you can halve the amount one way or another ( some people squint , some close one eye , some block the light ) then your brain 's happy .

For maximum efficiency and low emissions , precise fuel delivery is essential . Carburetors are simple mechanical devices that lack this precision . Fuel injectors are more precise . They are easily integrated into electronic , computerized engine management systems , to maximize fuel economy and performance while minimizing harmful exhaust emissions . The idea here is the \" fuel injection \" is just one system in the role of engine and vehicle management . The electronic control module ( ECM ) in a modern vehicle relies on dozens of sensors to measure all aspects of vehicle operation , driver input , and key environmental conditions . In turn , the ECM controls fuel metering , transmission function , ignition function , engine power and engagement of emissions devices . Depending on the vehicle , the ECM also controls visual displays for the driver . Related device such as the Body Control Module ( BCM ) and other control modules control various facets of vehicle operation . Direct injection is simply a greater refinement of the fuel injection principle . Traditional electronic fuel injectors essentially are atomizers - nozzles that spray an atomized fuel mist into the intake manifold , typically just upstream of the intake valve . As the valve opens , the injector releases a very short burst of atomized fuel at the valve , where it can be sucked into the combustion chamber . Careful analysis has shown this traditional injector has some minor shortcomings . The fuel may be imperfectly atomized , resulting in incomplete combustion . Also , the amount of fuel may not be ideal for the engine 's operating requirements , because of the flow dynamics of the intake manifold . Direct injection is designed to overcome these shortcomings . Atomized fuel is injected directly into the combustion chambers , for more precise metering , and at extremely high pressure , for better atomization . The result is more engine power , better fuel efficiency and economy , and with lower emissions .","Thunder_bird has given a good description of the pros and cons , but here 's more description on what they each are . In order for fuel to burn , it needs to be mixed in just the right ratio with air . A carburettor is a mechanical device for doing this . As the air is sucked into the engine , it is sucked through a narrow gap , which causes its pressure to temporarily drop . The drop in pressure is used to suck fuel into the airflow . The more air that is being sucked into the engine , the greater the drop in pressure , and so more fuel gets added into the air . Fuel injection does n't reply on a drop in pressure sucking fuel into the airflow . Instead , it uses a mechanism for measuring the amount of airflow into the engine , and then a computer ( usually an electronic computer , but some very early versions used a mechanical computer ) works out how much fuel is required , and injects the fuel into the airflow . Direct injection is similar , but instead of the fuel being injected into the air flowing through the manifold , it is injected directly into the cylinders of the engine .","Next time you are at a restaurant , take your drink and blow across the top of your straw ( please do n't do this with booze , it 's too wasteful ) . It will suck your beverage up the straw and make a nice Dr. Peppery mist that will spray on the person sitting across from you . A carburetor uses the same principle that allows this to happen to make a gasoliney mist that then is split up in the intake manifold to travel into the individual cylinders . It 's a little more complicated , for instance it has a float valve like is in your toilet tank to keep a reservoir of fuel full ( so it wo n't work very long at certain angles ) , but if you can spray your significant other with your drink by blowing sharply across the top of your straw you should understand the basics . Usually , if the fuel air ratio is not ideal it has to be adjusted manually . This means its pretty much set and ca n't be adjusted for different conditions on the fly . Fuel injection and direct injection can and often are adjusted by your car 's computer . I wo n't spend a lot of time explaining how this works because it has already been covered better than I could ."],"13140":["It 's pretty messy , and the relevant history goes back quite a ways . Like over 150 years . And is n't even all related to the immediate vicinity . Okay . So for starters , \" Ukraine \" has n't actually existed as a distinct geopolitical entity for all that long . Call it 90 years or so . It only became an independent state as part of the larger conflict that was WWI and the Russian Civil War . Ukraine was actually a major state in its own right around AD 1000 , but that stopped being a going concern by the twelfth century or so . Since that time it has been variously controlled by Poland ( which was actually a major Eastern European power for a while there , believe it or not ) , Lithuania ( same deal ) , Russia , and the Ottoman Empire ( or whatever Turkic power was in vogue at any particular time ) . It 's been contested by neighboring powers for like a thousand years . So there are a * lot * of people and countries in the region who feel some kind of historic and\/or ethnic connection with the territory which is now Ukraine . In particular , Russia conquered an independent Crimean state in 1783 and fought the Crimean War against the Ottomans and other European powers in the 1850s . It 's had an uninterrupted military presence on the peninsula for over two centuries . It 's the home port of the Russian Black Sea fleet . Okay , fast forward a bit . Ukraine becomes independent around 1921 and sets up a socialist government . It immediately aligns with the USSR . Things continue in that vein until the 1990s when the USSR and its empire collapse . There were already a bunch of ethnic Russians in Ukraine before this , but the better part of a century of Soviet rule pushed those numbers up considerable . Eventually , the socialist government is deposed , and replaced by . . . well an earlier version of the mess that 's in there now . Key problem for the new Ukrainian government : there is n't really a private market to speak of . Pretty much everything is provided by the government at no cost to the citizens . Sounds good , eh ? Well understand that they were n't providing all that much . Bread lines , no access to modern consumer goods , etc . Whatever . The key issue here is that * heating oil * is provided for free . Not much mind you , but it 's free . So when the post - Soviet government takes over , they do n't really want to be in the business of providing all of the goods \/ services in the economy . But heating oil is n't free , and the Ukrainian economy is in such a shitty state that the population ca n't actually afford to pay for heating oil on the open market . The solution is massive government subsidies . The Ukrainian government agrees to buy a crap ton of natural gas from Russia -- which produces a ton of it -- and provide it to the population at a fraction of the actual cost . The idea was to eventually wean the population off this subsidy , but that never really happened . A substantial and growing portion of the Ukrainian national budget went to natural gas , to the point that the government was tens of billions in debt to Russia . Russia , of course , led by Putin , is becoming increasingly disgruntled with its post - Soviet status . Putin thinks that he collapse of the USSR was the greatest political tragedy of the 20th century , and a lot of Russians agree with him . They 're itching to revitalize Russia 's role on the world stage -- and to right perceived slights on Russian dignity like the bombing of Serbia back in the 1990s ( different conversation ; suffice it to say that the Russians took that * really * personally ) . Moscow is thus very interested in dominating the governments in former Soviet republics , particularly Ukraine , which owes it a lot of money . Then , to the West 's bemusement and Moscow 's dismay , domestic protests in Ukraine lead to the ouster of the pro - Soviet president . Putin sees an opportunity to annex Crimea -- which had been ceded to Ukraine by the USSR a while ago -- and takes it . The West is n't about to go to war with Russia for any reason , so that happened . That 's about the sum of it .","I recommend this video , very informative : URL_0","being a Ukrainian citizen living in Russia it looks like the scene from The Simpsons where Russia suddenly turns from a friendly partner to a soviet union and an enemy"],"7616":["so it slices , rather than chops .

If you have it just chop down , you stand a much better chance of just crushing the neck rather than having the head get cut off .","People are telling you the answer ... slicing v. chopping , shear force and pressure over area ... but not really describing the difference . A human neck for example does n't have a super tough skin , but there are tougher bits relative to other bits . And the bits are often discrete , meaning if you succeed in cutting one bit , you can chalk it up as job done and move onto the next bit , one at a time . Imagine you are cutting a tomato . The skin of the fruit is somewhat harder for a knife blade to get through compared to the ' guts ' .

The best examples we have of this situation come from [ feral children ] ( URL_1 ) who have grown up deprived of language contact . Do n't listen to anyone who says that pathological cases make bad examples , because they are our only non - anecdotal examples . Let me make a crucial distinction early on here that this is different from language deprived children who still grew up in a linguistically rich environment , such as deaf children growing up with speaking parents who do not know a sign language . We 'll look at those examples in a moment . Feral children show us that thought does exist without language , however complex thought becomes difficult without a linguistic framework to reference . This has a lot to do with the plasticity of the brain . What that means is that the brain is very flexible and able to restructure itself , however the feral children provide evidence that there is a critical period in this plasticity , a period in which the brain is especially flexible , that turns off once they get older and is lost forever . What we find with these children is that they sound and act developmentally disabled , even though there may not be anything wrong with their brain . Concepts beyond their basic needs are hard for them to express , and unfortunately that also makes it hard for us to tell just how thoroughly they actually understand them . Now regarding the deaf children with speaking parents : What typically happens is they develop what we call [ home - signing ] ( URL_0 ) . This is different from actual sign language because it is not a complete and grammatically bound linguistic system . Think of it like when soldiers use hand signals in the field . It gets a general message but is not as refined as actual language . Once again we find that these people are subject to a critical period , but it seems to be extended because their brain is at least being stimulated in some way . Home - sign children put in a sign language environment will quickly learn the sign language , or even create their own if all of the other children are also home - signers . What this shows us is that the capacity for language is innate , and thus inseparably tied to our ability to think .

He gives a twenty minute TED talk on it . If you 're interested in him or learning more about holding your breath it is very informative even if he is a bit annoying . Regardless of how annoying he still shows a level of commitment that is very impressive . Here it is : URL_0","To go into a little bit more depth than most of the other posts here . First you need to know that there are multiple different records for breath holding . The record that is at 22 minutes is one where you are allowed to breath pure oxygen for a certain of amount time prior to your attempt . This greatly increases the amount of oxygen in your blood . However the record where they use normal air is still at around 13 minutes if I recall correctly . There are a couple techniques involved in holding your breath . One of the most important things in making holding your breath easier is a low amount of Carbon dioxide . Contrary to what you might think it is high levels of CO2 that tips of your body that you need to breath and invokes the impulse of breathing . So the way to make holding your breath as easy as possible is to lower you levels of CO2 and preventing it from going up . Lowering your CO2 levels is done by breathing exercises . Hyperventilating on purpose rids the body of CO2 and makes it a lot easier to hold your breath for extended periods of time . Next you will want to use as little oxygen as possible . This means staying as still as possible . Not even the slightest movements . You will also want to lower your metabolic rate since this also takes oxygen . You can do this by simply fasting for a while before your attempt . Lowering your heart rate also prevents oxygen from being used to quickly . To give you an idea when David Blaine trained for his world record attempt he had a heart rate at rest of about 38 beats per minute ( unfortunately during his actual attempt it never went down below 100 until the very end ) Of course on top of that having lots of oxygen in your body is just as important . Oxygen is carried in the blood by red blood cells and having more red blood cells means more oxygen is able to be in your blood . Your body automatically makes more red blood cells if you live in a oxygen rare atmosphere like high in the mountains . This is usually just done artificially with practice in low pressure rooms . You also just have to practice ignoring the impulse to breath . It takes some pretty insane self control and motivation to do this well and it 's of course very risky . Most of this information comes from the TED talk David Blaine gave and my own interest in free diving and breath holding ."],"11027":["Social Security itself can not run out . The common misconception is that Social Security is deposited into some big account that will eventually run out . This is not true . Basically think of Social Security like a business : You have the Social Security tax , which is revenue . Then there are people being paid social security , which is an expense . Since Social Security 's conception , there has always been a surplus ( where the government takes in more taxes than pays out benefits ) . This surplus goes to an account called \" Social Security Surplus \" . ~~The money in the Surplus Account is used to pay down the national debt.~~ The problem that politicians refer to , however , is that with the entirety of the Baby Boomers ( the largest segment of the U.S. Population ) about to retire in the next decade , for the first time in U.S. history there is going to be a Social Security deficit . This is fine for the first year , but when people retire between 55 and 65 generally , we can reasonably expect that they will live another 20 - 30 years assuming they are healthy in most regards . The dilemma with this is that the expense will continue to grow , but due to the Recession and unemployment rates , fewer people are paying into Social Security , so less revenue is actually being taken in . So while the government might be able to foot the bill for awhile , and the Baby Boomers might be ok with their retirement , there will most certainly not be enough money to cover Generations X and Y when they retire in 30 - 50 years . To answer the other part of your question , welfare is exclusively an expense , with no specific revenue to counteract it . The government actually makes profit off of Social Security , so it 's a huge deal when that goes away . In addition , people are naturally selfish ( not insulting anyone , that 's just part of being human ) , so the idea that we may not be able to retire as comfortably as we expected ( good lord man , do n't tell me we have to * save our money ? ! ? ! ? ! * ) and that all the money we 've paid into Social Security since we were 16 is going to be wasted kind of ticks us off . * If my answer was unsatisfactory , [ Khan Academy ] ( URL_0 ) does an excellent explanation on this subject . * * * EDIT :* * Corrected misinformation about the uses of the Social Security Trust account","\" Running out \" is a bit misleading . Most people will get money pulled each paycheck to go towards Social Security , so assuming the system does n't change , there will always be something to pay out to retirees . What can run out , though , is the Social Security Trust Fund . For a while now , Social Security has taken in more money than its paid out , and the excess has been put into the Trust Fund . We 're hitting the point , though , where the money coming in from Social Security taxes is less than what 's being paid out , which is what the Trust Fund is for , to make up the difference . The way it 's looking , eventually the Trust Fund will be used up , so there wo n't be anything to cover the shortfall . But again , there will still be money coming in , so Social Security will still pay out something , just not as much as promised . Unless , of course , the system gets changed to prevent that . It 's happened before , and old people vote .","Social security funds come from a very specific tax . Welfare and other entitlement programs are part of the general fund . Check your last pay stub -- there will be a line for FICA taxes and a line for Social Security taxes . They can both run out if the tax money stops coming in , but Social Security works on the ( incorrect ) principle that there will always be more people paying into it than taking from it ."],"13914":["I teach seniors how to use technology on a daily basis . I would have to disagree with \/u \/ Hussive on the point that seniors are not moved by technology . Often times , I find them wanting desperately to use it , but not even knowing the basics , it might as well be astrophysics . Alternatively , they may like some forms of technology , like TV and digital music , but despise other forms such as iPads and Smart TVs . Most likely , this dislike spawns from technological illiteracy or misinformation . I had a client that told me she would only use the internet if there was a shortcut to the website on the desktop . Her reasoning ? She thought she would get lost and never find her way back to the pages she wanted . Apparently she did n't understand the concept of the close window button :) But to answer your question , seniors normally have a hard time grasping technology because they do nt understand the basic concepts .

The current balance had worked for several years , but there are forces acting on this balance that serve to destabilize things . 1 ) Money Conferences negotiate more money through TV deals that are based on the bank - ability of the teams in the conference and the number of TV sets that the schools can be counted on to serve . If your conference games are desired by major markets , and lots of them , then you all get more money . This is one reason that larger conferences are attractive : if a conference that does not have a footprint in a major market can add a popular school from that missing market , then everybody gets a nice boost in annual revenues through the TV contract . 2 ) Emotion Some schools perceive themselves to be in positions of power , and some do not . In the last go - around ( 2010 ) Nebraska and Colorado felt themselves to be in low power positions for negotiating conference policy . Add to that their difficulties in recruiting talent - rich areas , and you have a recipe for discontent In this go - around ( 2011 ) Texas A & M 's institutional \" powerlessness \" is becoming an emotional wedge between itself and the Big XII . They do not stand to make more money in the SEC ( in fact , less in the short term ) , but they are tired of being dictated to by the haves ( Texas and OU ) . They imagine that , by going to the SEC , they will command more respect due to their alignment with a more powerful conference . This may be true , or it may be false . Also , A & M suspects that future contracts in the SEC will be richer than those in the Big XII , which may or may not be true as well . However , do not discount the emotional element of this move ; getting free from Texas and OU is a big selling point for them . How Texas A & M will handle the Alabamas , Floridas , and LSUs of the world , and how that could be better for them , remains to be seen . 3 ) Leverage Whereas previously all conferences ( that count ) had 11 or 12 teams , as soon as a major conference breaches that by adding to 13 or 14 , the game is on . All major conferences now have to respond by adding teams to match or risk losing relative power ( and therefore negotiating ability , and therefore money ) . TL;DR : Essentially , Texas A & M is kicking off an arms race by de - stabilizing the major conference balance because they are butt - hurt about not being in charge of the Big XII and being second fiddle in their own state , even though the move has a high probability of costing them many millions of dollars in the short term through contract penalties . The SEC is enabling it because it will make the member institutions more powerful , and give them better access to fertile Texas recruiting grounds .","Main reasons : 1 . TV Money - The Pac-10 had average revenue amongst the 6 BCS conferences . They added two teams ( Utah and Colorado - not really huge names ) and got the richest TV deal in college football . 2 . Stability - the Big 12 had Texas , Oklahoma and everyone else . When Texas wanted more money than everyone else , the other teams had to accept it , or leave ( as Nebraska , Colorado and Texas A & M decided to do ) . If , for example , a league has 16 teams , including Texas , Oklahoma , USC and Oregon , then no single team has enough leverage to cause instability . 3 . Take power away from the BCS - the BCS makes a lot of money by controlling how the college football postseason is played . If the top 64 teams are in 4 conferences , the conferences can negotiate with each other to get rid of the BCS if they try to assert too much power . 4 . Playoffs ? ! Again , if we have 4 conferences with the 64 best teams , we could ( somewhat ) easily have the 4 conference champions play in a 4 - team playoff for the national championship ."],"11868":["In Texas you are sent to the prison of your birth gender and usually put into a special cell block where you do n't have a roommate .

Basic gist of the three : Pros for Linux : Very adaptable and hackable . Also a very good OS if you want to learn how computers work , since all the components are exposed and customizable . As a programmer I love the command line interface . You can make your OS as lightweight as you want , or as feature rich . If you 're doing a lot of programming or content creation , I find most Linux desktop environments more focused on that aspect . Cons : Depending on your distro , it can be a pain to setup . However , most popular distros like Ubuntu or Fedora basically work \" right out of the box \" with little more configuration . If you 're used to certain Windows \/ OSX applications , you 'll have to resort to open source clones of that software or using the WINE emulator . Currently it lacks good video game support , but I think Steam OS will really change that soon . Many video games may not work on it nicely , although many will run in WINE just fine . Pros for Windows : It 's common . Most everyone knows how to use it . And most software is written for it . It also supports a ton of hardware and most vendors will write drivers for it . Video games ! Cons : Not a whole lot to be honest . It 's a nice well - rounded OS . If it matters to you , the command line interface is n't as nice as what you have in Linux or OSX , but for the general user this does n't matter . OSX Pros : It 's slick and a lot of things \" work out of the box \" just like Windows . It 's based off of BSD , so if you 're used to Bash ( a command line interface ) then it 's great . It 's a nice blend of \" just works \" and unix - like tools . Cons : If you 're used to Windows , the interface may be confusing . Also the lack of video game support that Windows has . So there 's a basic pros \/ cons list . I would say that the OS almost does n't matter these days , since most users just use their computers to surf the internet , check their mail , watch movies , or listen to music ... and all three OS 's can do those tasks fairly well . If you like playing video games , currently Windows is the best supported .

The effect , when done right , was startling compared to other kinds of music . For pop music , where you are competing for people 's attention continuously , the technique proved to be very commercially successful . Imagine that you are looking at a graph of the amount of sound energy being produced by a recording . Let 's start with just the drum . On beats , the energy graph hits a peak . Between beats , the energy graph is at zero . Now you layer in the bass . The bass notes create more peaks on the graph so there 's less time when the graph is at zero . Layer in the guitars and the vocals . There 's a lot more time when the graph is above zero , and relatively few places where the graph is at zero . Maybe it never goes all the way to zero , but instead just shows a variance between a high point and a low point . That 's what most pop music looked like before the Wall of Sound . The Wall of Sound is an engineering technique that seeks to keep the sound graph at the peak as much as possible . By controlling all the aspects of the recording using multiple tracks , overdubbing , and other techniques , the Wall of Sound produces a recording where there are very few low points on that sound energy graph . The result is that the sound is distinctly more \" powerful \" than the average piece of recorded music . The trick is that if you just turned up all the microphones used in the recording session or had the guitarists play endless chords , you end up with a muddled sonic mess . It 's like mixing all the colors on a paint palette - you 'll end up with an unappetizing brown color .

If there were 100 people and 10 people not working , then there 'd be 10 % unemployment . If the population grew to 150 with 13 unemployed , you 'd have a drop in percentage of unemployment ( 13\/150 = 8.7 % ) while a new record high of 13 people unemployed .","Because \" unemployed \" and \" not working \" have different definitions . Unemployed is generally a person that does not have a job , but is actively seeking one . Someone that is just \" not working \" may not be actively seeking a job and therefore is not \" unemployed \" .","5.6 % of 316.1 M people is still almost 18 M people .

There is no money , only trading food . Let 's also assume that everyone generally has enough to eat , but that everyone wants a more varied diet . Let 's say one year there are not many potatoes , but lots of chicken . What will most likely happen is that the village that produces chicken will throw in some extra chicken for free , to encourage people to take it off his hands , and the potato village will ask for more food in exchange for his potatoes . Some people may want to just take the extra chicken , while others choose to trade more milk for potatoes , because they really like french fries . My village has decided that we do n't want to change the price of apples , because if we always give them away for cheap , everyone will always buy them . So we always watch the wheat village , who is the biggest and most reliable supplier , and trade for just a little bit less than they do , no matter how much or how little we produce . When another village is looking to buy food , they will often come to us first , because we give away our apples for less than the wheat farmer takes . Out own villagers will often choose a less varied diet , because for them to trade their apples to other villages would mean they would not have enough to eat . And so over time , we plant more apples to fill the demand from other villages , while needing little from them .

The drainage down the back of your throat is what causes you to cough , and the constant coughing makes your throat hurt .","The other comments explained it well already , but I 'll throw in some more details in case you were still curious . Your nasal and oral cavities ( nose and mouth ) basically have posterior openings at the throat area . When you have a runny nose , chances are that it 's runny on both ends and that mucous is going down your throat , as well . One possibility of mucous going down your throat is that it enters into your upper airway . When something goes through the opening into the airway , it 's called \" penetration . \" The body has safeguards that prevent food \/ etc . from penetrating . Among these is the epiglottis , which normally retroverts ( folds backward ) and covers the airway entrance when you swallow , and coughing when it senses that something is going down the wrong way . The purpose is to prevent things from penetrating into the airway , and going below the vocal folds and being aspirated into the lungs . When you have a cold , one issue ( at least for me ) is that the volume of mucous is much greater than normal . This can be problematic when someone is asleep or otherwise unaware that mucous might be built up in their throat . Specifically in my case when I 'm sick , phlegm and mucous are worst when I get up in the morning . Thankfully , the body tends to be sensitive to coughing . Unfortunately , lack of hydration , repeated coughing , and other factors can hurt the throat lining , and it does n't help that some sick people experience throat irritation \/ inflammation as symptoms in addition to everything else ."],"1125":["1 ) The internet is basically a bunch of wires connecting a bunch of computers together . 2 ) Search engines do n't search the \" entire internet . \" They search their respective index .

The workers break up rock which is carted out of the mine for external industrial processing ( further smashing and washing with chemicals ) . * Uncut diamonds are n't nearly as valuable as cut , polished stones . * Also , uncut diamonds are hard for a non - professional to identify and value . It 's easy to mistake them for totally mundane minerals ( and vice versa ) . This is even more true when you 're working in a mineshaft , with little to no light . So at the outset , it 's very hard to come by and identify loose diamonds . It 's not like Minecraft or Terraria . You do n't have valuable diamonds just lying around for the taking . But lets say Miner Joe comes across a small diamond every now and again , which is small enough to smuggle out of the mine . The issue facing him now is whether it 's worth the risk . * * His potential take :* Joe 's diamond is small , uncut , and ungraded , so it 's not exactly a big - ticket item . Plus he has to sell it in his impoverished home country , so he 's not going to get U.S. retail prices . Not even close . Furthermore , if he 's a diamond miner , his buyer may well know that and probably leverage it against him ( i.e. , the buyer could threaten to turn him in ) . So Joe probably takes another hit on the price or maybe he asks a middle man to sell it for him ( for a cut ) . All told , I 'd wager that Joe gets a few hundred bucks for his diamond . Do n't get me wrong - that 's a sizeable chunk of money . But let 's see what he has to lose ... * * The risks :* There are a number of ways Joe could get caught . He could be seen pocketing the diamond by a supervisor , security personnel , or even a fellow miner ( who is probably rewarded for reporting him ) . He also runs the risk of a random inspection - even an X - Ray - as he leaves the mining camp . If he 's caught , he 'll be fired and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . Given the fact that diamond mining is probably one of the most steady , full - time jobs available to him , and the fact that his country 's justice and penal systems are n't known to be merciful , Joe stands to lose quite a bit . In other words , I think the reward : risk ratio is pretty damn low . I do n't doubt that theft is still a substantial problem , but I think that the opportunity and the benefits for such theft are probably substantially lower than most people think . I 've also read that De Beers and its competitors actually buy up the uncut diamonds sold into the pawn shops and markets in the communities around their mines .

TL;DR Versions : DNA is the set of instructions that tells your cells what to do . A gene is a specific instruction encoded in your DNA . Cells are the smallest thing that can be considered living . Every living creature is made of them , and every cell must have a copy of the DNA of the creature it is a part of . A chromosome is compacted DNA , a way to save space and organize DNA so it can be stored inside of a cell without taking up all of the available space and getting tangled up . Long versions : DNA is an extremely large molecule that serves as instructions for the various activities carried out inside a cell . It 's shaped like a very long and twisted ladder ( this shape is called a double helix ) . Each rung on the latter is made from two of four chemical bases ( also called nucleotides ): adenine ( A ) , guanine ( G ) , cytosine ( C ) , and thymine ( T ) . A pairs with T and G pairs with C ; in other words , a rung can be made of A and T or G and C , but not with A and G or C and T. Also , each chemical makes up one half of the rung ; you can have A on the left and T on the right , for example . This makes it so the DNA can be ' unzipped ' and split into two halves . The ability to be unzipped and the specific pairs the nucleotides have are what make it possible for your cells to decode the DNA . The instructions in DNA are stored in the pattern these bases follow . For example , if a series of five rungs is composed of the pairs A - T , G - C , C - G , T - A , T - A , their sequence can be described by AGCTT ( the pattern followed by one half of the strand ) . If this sequence caused some trait to show itself in an organism , such as by causing a person 's eyes to be green , it is called a gene . Genes have variable lengths . Some are a few thousand bases , but others can be millions long . A cell is the smallest building block of life . You are made of trillions of them . Each cell performs a certain function , which is dictated by the part of your DNA that particular cell decodes . For instance , red blood cells carry oxygen around your body . Groups of cells that perform a similar function form tissues . Muscle cells make muscle tissue . Again , DNA tells your cells how to work together so they can accomplish the collective task the tissue must fulfill . Tissues grouped together to perform a certain function make organs . Your heart is made of muscle tissue and connective tissue . Organisms are made from a collection of organs . Now , think about how much space your body takes up , and the fact that there are trillions of cells that compose you . That does n't leave much room for each cell , does it ? Each of these cells must store your DNA , and DNA is , as I mentioned earlier , a very large molecule . This is where chromosomes come in . A chromosome is essentially DNA in compact form . DNA compacting itself into a chromosome is similar to the way thread can be rolled up onto a spool . This makes the DNA take up much less space in your cells .","I think you 've got a lot of people explaining DNA and chromosomes , but I 'm not sure cells has been done clearly . A cell is the smallest unit of life ; it is called this because at its essence , a cell is a sack with things inside it that take in energy , use them to do things , and then expel the waste . There are living things that consist of nothing but single cells ( such as bacteria and yeast ) , then there are more complex things that function as a group of the exact same cells working together ( such as sea sponges ) , and at the most complex end , you have organisms like human which are collections of a huge number of different types of cells that all rely on each other in order to live . So , exactly what is a cell ? The simplest cells are prokaryotic cells ( like bacteria ) . They are sacks of lipid molecules ( similar to a fat molecule ) , with all of their required molecules ( DNA molecules , protein molecules , enzymes^t , energy molecules , etc . ) free floating inside of them . They take food directly through pores in the cell membrane , enzymes bump into the food and turn it into energy for the cell to use to repair itself , go find food , etc . More complex are the eukaryotic cells ( yeasts all the way to humans ) . These are the huge Ford factories to the little prokaryotic car shops you 've got in your garage . The same way an organism ( human ) has organs that do things inside , eukaryotic cells have * organelles * that different functions inside of them . For example , the nucleus packages up all the DNA , the mitochondria makes energy for the whole cell , etc . In a larger organism , these cells are specialists , and have other cells brining them any nutrients they need - for example , a muscle cell does n't bother keeping extra food molecules in storage because it counts on fat cells to always have a steady stream of sugar available to it in the blood stream . But still , even in more complex systems - a cell is something that takes in nutrients , uses it to make energy , and uses that energy to do a job . ^t enzymes are protein molecules that do things because of their shape \/ chemistry .

Obviously , this conversion loses some quality : the resulting wave is an approximation of the original one . And there are two parameters determining how closely it resembles the original wave : sampling rate and bit depth . Sampling rate is how often the amplitude is measured . Most common values are 44100 , 48000 , and 96000 . Bit depth is how many data is written for each measurement . 16 bits means that there are 2 ^ 16 = 65536 possible different values of amplitude . 24 bits means 16777216 different values .

When your start working with squares , it is n't long before you realize that the square of any number is always a positive number . The question that follows is , then what happens when you take the square root of a negative number ? Well nothing happens , the square root of a negative number just does n't exist . Then some old random greek dude said , imagine , there is some number i whose square is -1 .. Now suddenly we have a way to express the square root of every negative number ! square root of -25 is 5i . It turns out that the ability to express the square roots of negative numbers has very useful applications in engineering so we adopted i and kept it . But it still remains that i has no clear significance when counting . for instance if I had i apples , what does it even mean ? ! For a long time , it was considered quite pointless and hence the name imaginary numbers as opposed to the other real numbers . [ As for how they are used . ] ( URL_0 )","If you want to know what exactly complex numbers are , [ here is a comment I wrote about that a little while ago . ] ( URL_0 ) To understand what they are used for , you need to understand sort of how they work . A complex number has two parts : a * real * part and an * imaginary * part . So , in a way , a complex number is really * two * numbers . But those two numbers work together in such a way as to make it sensible to treat them as a single object , which we call a complex number . The usefulness to engineering comes from the weird way that complex numbers multiply together . The real numbers are one dimensional \u2014 that is to say , you only need one piece of information to pin down where a real number is on a number line . Multiplication between two real numbers can be thought of as stretching . That is , when I multiply a number by two , it stretches from looking like this \\--------- to looking like this \\------------------ For multiplication between complex numbers , we keep the \" stretching \" interpretation for the real part , but the imaginary part causes a * rotation * . Rotation can happen because complex numbers are two dimensional , so instead of looking like line segments in a one dimensional line , they look like line segments in a two dimensional plane . So when I multiply a number by , say , 2 + 2i , we end up going from -------- to \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ The length of the line segment that the number is represented by doubles because of the real part 2 , and rotates because of the imaginary part 2i . This is the hurdle . * Complex numbers are completely different numbers * . They are not the same as the real numbers that you know . In particular , there is a brand new kind of multiplication that behaves a lot like the multiplication that you know ( associative , commutative , multiplication by 0 gives 0 , etc ) but behaves qualitatively differently ( scale+rotate instead of just scale ) . So the question remains , how could this possibly be useful ? Well , it turns out that \" scale and rotate \" is a transformation that models a lot of things in the real world . Here 's an example . Think about looking at a tire swing from a bird 's eye view . I walk up to the tire swing and push it so that it starts rotating around where it is hanging from . What kind of path does the tire swing follow ? Well the longer it moves , the less momentum it has , so the radius of the circle that it traces out is getting smaller and smaller . But it is still rotating around in the same direction . In other words , it follows a path * which scales and rotates * . Its path can be modelled by multiplying a complex number by another complex number over and over again . This is the most intuitive picture of where this comes up in nature I think , but it 's definitely far from the only one . In general , anything which oscillates and changes magnitude is a good candidate for something whose behaviour can be modelled well by complex numbers .","I wrote a similar post to this on \/r \/ askscience a while ago . First of all , the terminology is unfortunate - there 's nothing more mystical or imaginary or complicated about i than any other number . It 's just a word that we use to differentiate it from \" real \" numbers , which refer to specific kinds of numbers . So originally , we start of with counting numbers : 0 , 1 , 2 , .... But pretty soon , we start seeing equations that we ca n't solve with these numbers ; for example , if you see x + 5 = 0 you ca n't solve for x in terms of a counting number . This is why we introduce negative numbers - precisely so that we can solve these equations . So now we 've got ... , -2 , -1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , ... But now let 's try another equation : 2x + 1 = 0 . It 's easy to see that we still ca n't solve this , even though we already added negatives . This is why we have to add fractions ; now it becomes possible to solve any * linear * equation . But this still is n't good enough , since we ca n't solve equations like x^(2 ) + 1 = 0 . No real number possibly does that . This is why we introduce the complex numbers : it turns out that we can actually solve * any * polynomial now . This is a property called being \" algebraically complete . \" It means that if you have any polynomial equation ( call it p(x ) ) , you can find an x with p(x ) = 0 .

A player can make a very large sum of money over the course of their career even while using PEDs . The current CBA ( Collective Bargaining Agreement ) does not allow for the modification of contracts , so even if a player is caught using PEDs , they will be suspended , not get paid while suspended , but come right back and start getting paid once the suspension is served . A perfect example is Ryan Braun . His contract with the Brewers was extended through 2020 and is worth $ 105 million dollars . He will serve a 61 game suspension ( through the end of 2013 ) and will be back on the field in 2014 . Braun was able , through the use of PEDs , to inflate his value to get a high value , long term contract . The monetary reward of using PEDs is currently so great , the players are willing to take the risk of getting caught and accepting the suspension .","Baseball is a game of inches . Literally a couple of inches can be the difference between a hit and an out . In a sport where statistics are such a big deal , especially in terms of how much one will be payed , choosing to cheat to gain a competitive advantage seems like a valid option . A baseball season could be compared to a marathon . 160 games with 600 + at bats means the smallest advantage will be crucial to ones success . This , combined with pretty dreadful drug enforcement rules \/ testing practices , open access to whatever drug one might want , and the idea that one is , in some way , \" above the law . \"","Most of these answers are incomplete . I 'm going to try and give you a list of reasons . First off , let 's be clear that there was widespread use in the MLB and NFL . NFL use of anabolic steroids are known to be as far back as the 1960s . So you asked , \" Why is it different ? Why is it a bigger deal in baseball ? \" First off , drug testing for steroids in the NFL began in 1987 . They actually began suspending players in 1989 . This curtailed use in the NFL greatly , albeit did not eliminate it completely . The MLB first began a testing procedure in 2003 , 16 YEARS after the NFL . There are different reasons for the MLB being so slow to react to their rampant steroid use . Some are : - The CBA ( Collective Bargaining Agreement ) between the MLBPA ( Players Association ) and MLB . - Simply put , a blind eye was turned . It was obvious in some clubhouses but others were secretive . The MLB did not know how widely used it was and did n't make efforts to find out . - MLB employed a reactive program instead of a preventive . It was not until the 1998 , when McGuire and Sosa began threatening records , that the issue was talked about . ( More on this point later ) - NFL 's incentive for their ban was player safety . Steroids make players faster , bigger , and stronger in both sports ; the difference was that one sport was contact . All these issues led to the creation of a culture . So why is it more of a problem in baseball ? - When a drug has been around for two decades without being banned , it creates the culture mentioned above . Players are less likely to stop . - No other sport in the US has contracts like baseball . All contracts in baseball are guaranteed in full . If you sign 100 million contract , you will get that no matter what . In the NFL , you actually have a guaranteed portion when you sign . This is important because a player contract can not be voided if he uses steroids . I.E the only money Ryan Braun will lose is 3.3 million during his suspension of his monstrous contract he signed with the Brewers . - Minor Leagues . So many more players are trying to break into the MLB than in any other sport . There are more people using because of the idea that they just need to get there . This makes for a unique system , and when you reached the majors with the use of steroids , you keep using them to stay there . But the main reason that believe steroids are more of an issue is the uniqueness of baseball . I 've heard things like \" it 's a game of inches . \" What sport is n't a game of inches ? That 's literally football 's nickname ! No no no , it 's because baseball is a game of records . This is 100 % the main reason why we are so angry with baseball players who juice rather than football or basketball players . Baseball is a game of records . When you look at Football , a players career can be defined by championships . In basketball , a players career is defined heavily by championships . In baseball , it rarely factors . It comes down to stats and personal accomplishments . And that is why baseball fans and the MLB despise steroid use because it messes with the integrity and its genuineness . Records start to fall , ICONIC records , with steroids playing a large part . From 1998 - 2003 , how different would it have been if just one of Sosa , Bonds or McGuire had n't used steroids ? They were breaking records that stood for decades , the most iconic and memorable records in all of sports : 61 home runs in a season and 755 career home runs . When all the players who broke these records were linked to steroids , all it showed was that those were needed to reach that level . And when you look back at a generation of players , we will have a multitude not get into the Hall of Fame . When we look at the Hall , there will be a giant gap in time . You look at Piazza , Clemens , Bonds , Sosa , McGuire ... the greatest players of a generation may not get enshrined . And that all comes down to the fact they cheated and manipulated what baseball and its fans care most about : Records ."],"6272":["[ Green P1 phosphors ] ( URL_0 ) had long persistence ( decay time ) .

Because the atmosphere is denser lower down High initial speeds would be very ineffective , and IT turns out beating gravity is hard enough without added air resistance . Also , getting to orbit is different from escaping our gravity influence . Orbit is held by gravity .

This effect , plus throttling and trajectory control lets the rocket Move faster when IT gets Into thinner air , instead of wasting more fuel than necessary fighting air resistance . At first we shoot vertically to get to thinner air , and as the atmosphere Thins we lean It over to build the horisontal speed component for orbiting . Why not bigger engines you Ask ?

Cyberpunk is effectively film noir set in an 80s\/90s concept of the high - tech near future in a society dominated by large corporations , with strong brand awareness as a recurring theme amid seamy tales of industrial espionage and corporate politics . Steampunk is a derivative of cyberpunk . Instead of an 80s\/90s concept of a high - tech near future , it is set in a Victorian - Britain concept of one . Thus instead of neon , black plastic and Japanese kitsch , the aesthetics are dominated by riveted brass instrumentation everywhere , pneumatic tubes , oak paneling , zeppelins and occasionally fanciful ray - guns . The society depicted is typically more Victorian - dominated by the state and military rather than commercial interests , and the protagonists , while roughly fitting the noir genre , tend to be more accidental adventurers and slightly dashing engineers than the cynical , gritty anti - heroes that dominate cyberpunk . Steampunk as an aesthetic rather than literary genre simply consists of a design aesthetic based on a weird mix of art deco , Boy 's Own Paper and early science fiction .","Today 's technology , if plastics had never been invented ."],"14349":["Think of it like this : everything is coded in binary . So a file could contain 1000 bits in a row that were all 0 . That can be compressed to something that instead says \" there are 1000 0 's here \" , which takes fewer bytes . It 's a bit more complicated but that 's the essence of it .","It 's sort of like the computer is using abbreviations so it does n't have to write down all the long words . When you create a zip file , it looks for repeated sequences and replaces them with something shorter . Then it makes a table of all the abbreviated stuff . That 's why zipping works well on stuff like text , but not so well on music where there is n't as much repetition .","Just to give a simplified example , imagine you have an 16 bit file that , in binary , is 1000000000000001 . There 's 14 consecutive zeroes that you can abbreviate ."],"3371":["Gravity . Every bit of matter attracts every other bit of matter . If stars were a shape like a cube or a cone , the edges \/ points would be further away from its center of mass then the rest , and the star 's own gravitational force would pull the high points in and the low points around them would get smoothed out . The same thing happens to planets while they 're being formed ( and are an amorphous blob of dust and rock , before gravity squeezes the all bits together into a ball ) .","Because of gravity . Gravity pulls everything towards everything else . The most stable shape in 3 dimensions under those conditions is a sphere . Note that most things are exactly spherical , they are spheroids ( basically a sphere you smoosh so it bulges out a bit ) .","5 year old explanation ( paraphrasing from Sagan 's Cosmos series ): Imagine a chunk of clay . Now imagine that you set it on a desk , and push down hard on the top with your hand . Now flip it to the side , and do the same . Flip it another angle , and smash it again . Keep doing this , and over time , you will be left with a sphere . This is why spheres are common , because everything with mass has gravity , and that gravity is pulling everything on the surface down towards the center ( this has the same effect as smashing clay with your hand pushing down ) . So , the more mass something has , the more of an effect gravity has , and hence the more it ends up like a sphere . Compare that with say , an asteroid , which does not have as much mass , and as such , can retain its odd shapes , like a potato or such ."],"4814":["Because they are trying to power through the economic duress by printing more money , until the print so much money that it no longers hold any weight .","Their currency falls in value , the country produces more of it and more currency = even lesser value until the inflation rate rises . Look at Zimbabwe for example .","So the basic problem that comes up is this : when the economy is in trouble , tax revenues go down . That means that the government needs to borrow money , or lay people off ( the latter would add to unemployment so they do n't like doing it ) . However , borrowed money has to be paid back , and since tax revenue is down , the government has a problem . The only options are a. ) to default on the debt , which usually means they 'd run out of lenders , or b. ) print money and use it to pay off debts . After that , it 's a question of scale - governments are always printing money , so it can be done without wrecking the inflation rate . But if things are very , very bad , they have to print more and more money . More money , same amount of things to buy , prices go up . Then things start to spiral . If you expect that $ 100 will buy less in a year , you wo n't lend me $ 100 if I only promise to pay you $ 102 next year . You 'll demand $ 110 , just to break even . The government will have to pay higher interest rates to keep borrowing , which means it needs to print MORE money , which means rates go up ... and so on ."],"4549":["Short answer : blur . When you shoot a scene at 60 fps , you get faster shutter speed and less blur . When you shoot 24fps , you get slower shutter speed , and more blur in the shot . Play back a scene at 24 fps which was shot at 24 fps , and there is more visible motion in each individual frame . Blur . Play back the same scene at the same rate which was shot at higher speeds , and each visible frame is sharper , making it seem as though it 's stuttering .","Cameras capture their scenes by opening a shutter for a period of time , exposing a film or image sensor to capture information about the scene . Each frame represents a period of time and moving objects will be shown as a blurry smear across the frame . Computer renderings are made of a calculated theoretical instant . As a single instant there can be no motion and moving objects are as clear as if stationary , and are only in one place . So you see a frame from a computer rendering contains less information than that of a camera , and the disconnects make it look jerky . A normal camera at least connects the ends of motion blurs while the rendered frames just jump from place to place .","Copied from a post i made answer this question ( post was removed , probably due to rule 7 , which this might also be ): A big reason is that video games render a single frame , which represents a single instance in time . It 's a series of pictures , with no way to represent the time \" in - between \" frames . Whereas for a film a single frame actually captures all of the movement that happen during that 1\/24th of a second , which is where motion blur comes from ."],"2215":["First , a little bit of background . Say you have a little country of your own , off on an island someplace . You and a few hundred friends , let 's say it is . You have a government \u2014 monarchy , republic , whatever ; does n't matter . That government has a treasury , but the treasury has no money in it . Which is fine \u2026 so long as you do n't actually want your government to * do * anything . If you just want to be able to say you have a government , knock yourself out ; nobody can stop you . But as soon as you want that government to * do * stuff \u2014 like hiring police officers , or raising an army \u2014 you need money in your treasury . The way this works is simple : Your treasury issues * bonds . * A bond is sort of like a very ritualized type of loan . You * sell * bonds with the promise to , after a set amount of time , * buy them back * for more than what you sold them for . So say you could sell a bond for $ 100 , with the promise to buy it back in a year for $ 110 . The difference between how much you promise to buy the bond back for and how much it sells for , expressed as a percentage , is called the * interest * , and the date on which you promise to buy it back is called the * maturity . * Who buys bonds ? Who cares ? Literally anybody with money can buy these bonds . Maybe those are private citizens in your country , maybe it 's your central bank ( that 's how you * create * money in your economy in the first place ) , or maybe it 's private citizens or other concerns in other countries . Point is , you offer the bonds for sale , and people agree to buy them . Thus do you get money in your treasury . Of course , people will only agree to buy your treasury 's bonds if they think there 's a good chance your treasury will buy them back when it promises to . If there 's reason to doubt your treasury 's willingness or ability to buy the bonds back , the people who have the money to buy them will demand a higher rate of interest to justify the higher risk . If there 's a * lot * of reason to doubt your treasury 's willingness or ability to pay , potential bond buyers might demand an * impossibly * high interest rate , making it effectively impossible for you to sell bonds , which in turn means it 's effectively impossible for you to fund your government 's activities . When one of those government activities you can no longer fund is * redeeming previously issued bonds * , you 've got yourself a sovereign debt crisis . And when a debt crisis gets * really * bad , you 've got yourself a sovereign default situation . So your question is what happens in a sovereign default situation ? Well , most of the time the answer is that does n't come up , because people , on the whole , are n't complete idiots . You can see a sovereign default situation coming from a mile away . When confidence in your bonds drops , and the demand price rises as a result , it 's clear that you 're * going * to have a problem in the future if you do n't take measures to prevent it . So people , as a rule , tend to have plenty of chances to see these things coming and avert them . But sometimes that does n't happen . ( In the case of Greece , it did n't play out that way because there was a big disconnect between the perceived value of Greek sovereign bonds and their * actual * value , due to what we could charitably call * reporting irregularities . * When that disconnect was resolved , the market value of Greek sovereign bonds dropped like a rock practically overnight . ) In those cases \u2014 where a sovereign default situation occurs anyway \u2014 one of two things can happen . Most of the time , you end up with what 's called a * controlled default . * This includes two parts : a restructuring of the sovereign debt , and a guarantor . In the broadest terms , sovereign debt restructuring just means rearranging things to reduce the debt burden on the treasury in question . That might mean getting holders of bonds to agree to new terms of repayment , or it might mean somebody buying up a bunch of bonds on the open market and then destroying them , whatever . It 's usually very complicated , but the general principle is that the country 's sovereign debt obligation is * changed * to reduce the scope of the problem and increase the chance that the holders of those bonds will get at least some return on their investment . A guarantor , on the other hand , is some body that injects capital into the treasury to cover bond repayments . In the modern era , that 's usually the International Monetary Fund , or IMF . The IMF functions much like an insurance underwriter : Countries pay into the fund as they can , and in return receive the right to draw on the fund if needed . In a sovereign default situation , the IMF will extend loans to the troubled treasury \u2014 usually loans with lots of very short strings attached \u2014 to guarantee the treasury retains the ability to redeem its outstanding bonds as it recovers from its debt crisis . Having a guarantor is good , because it raises market confidence in your ability and willingness to buy back new bonds , meaning you can get money flowing through your treasury again , which is how you climb out of a debt crisis . But remember I said that only happens \u2014 the thing with the restructuring and the guarantor \u2014 * most * of the time . It 's also entirely possible for a government to just say \" screw it , we ai n't payin ' . \" When that happens \u2014 and it 's worth remembering that in the modern era it 's * exceedingly rare * \u2014 the people who hold those bonds just take it in the shorts . The bonds become absolutely , literally worthless ; you 're better off burning them to heat your house than you are holding on to them in the hope of future repayment . Of course , the failure of a government to buy back its bonds does n't just render * those * bonds worthless . It renders * all future * bonds issued by the same treasury worthless . Because once a government exercises its power \u2014 and it is a power ; nobody can * stop it * from happening \u2014 to nullify its bonds , what 's to stop it from using that power again the next time a series of bonds matures ? Nothing , is the answer . So once a government has demonstrated its willingness to say \" screw you \" to investors , faith in that government is ruined forever . Meaning that government can no longer fund its operations , meaning it can no longer do anything , meaning it no longer has any reason to exist , as far as its people are concerned . That 's how you end up with things like the fall of the Weimar Republic \u2026 which is precisely why today we have this vast infrastructure in place to keep things from getting to that point .","Hapax_Legoman has a really good post , but it does n't really address what happens after the default . After the default , people no longer want your bonds . Your country now has difficulty borrowing any money at all and now must \" live within it 's means \" . Since this is nearly impossible to do immediately , governments usually print money in order to either directly fund government operations or to buy their own bonds . This is assuming that they have n't already been doing this like the US . Printing money means that inflation sets in . The more that gets printed , the higher the rates of inflation . Of course , this is exacerbated by the fact that other countries and people no longer want your currency . The currency become so devalued on foreign markets that it become very hard for businesses to purchase any good or services from foreign suppliers . This , in turn causes a massive crash of the economy and businesses begin going out of business . This , in turn causes massive unemployment . The only way it eventually turns around is when the government stops borrowing at all and stabilizes the currency by backing it in some way . Since it 's impossible to back it with the \" faith and credit \" of the government , it needs to be backed by either a stable commodity like gold , or another currency . Once that is done , then the economy can begin to stabilize and even grow . The upside is that now the country can begin to export since wages and production costs in taht country are now lower than their trading partners .","Argentina defaulted in 2002 . Their peso depreciated in value many times over , at the same time as hyper - inflation set in , with the result being that some people actually starved to death ( not many , there was quite a lot of assistance ) . Reported unemployment was 25 % , and I have read that \" real unemployment \" was over 50 % , which is ungodly terrifying . The only reason they could be getting by even now is that they were able to write off 66 % of their debt with the help of the IMF . That is not going to be available to Greece , and * definitely * not Italy or Portugal or Ireland , as their debts are far and away higher . Italy 's debt is essentially non - fixable . There is no real end - game there . You 'd likely have a massive emigration , especially of the educated , English speakers , and wealthy - which would make things even worse . Despite the massive international assistance and the slow growth of their economy , apparently inflation is still much higher than the international average ( in Argentina , sorry ) which is holding growth back and keeping poverty higher than it should be ."],"13510":["1 . it 's a shitty job . being \" strange \" makes it hard to get a job , but ... if you 're going to pay shit - wages you ca n't always being choosey . 2 .

The hostage ploy works just as well outside the cockpit , just tell the steward to inform the pilots they 're now flying to Cuba or passengers will start dying . It 's just as convincing as it would be to bust in personally really . Additionally it 'd do nothing to stop what most people really fear from terrorists on a plane - bombs .

Basic AI : rule based system For example , you can write a program to pretend to be a therapist ( \" Everybody hates me \" \/ \" Why do you say that everybody hates you ? \" ) . This would be a tedious task . You would have to write lots of hand written rules . It 's not rocket science , but it is still AI . However your program did n't learn the rules itself . You gave it the rules . This is a type of AI called a * rule based system * . # 2 . A bit smarter : machine learning but not deep learning The next step up is a type of AI where the bot will learn the rules . For example you could give it lots of example interactions between therapists and patients and define the kind of patterns that govern them and how complex you want your program to learn . You will also tell the program some useful hints : for example English is divided into words which are separated by spaces , it 's read left to right , and has nouns , verbs and adjectives , and the therapist is normally responding to the last thing the patient said . You define a score and say to the program , \" refine the rules until you 've got 90 % accuracy \" . This is a more advanced type of AI and it 's called * machine learning * . # 3 . Really smart : deep learning Now imagine you do n't tell your program anything about English grammar . You give it very few hints as to how to communicate in English . Maybe you do n't even tell it that spaces separate words . You define a very broad kind of program that could be thrown at any conversational task such as interactions with therapists garage mechanics in Japan or analysing financial news in German . You would just convert the patient 's words into numbers and propagate the numbers through a repeated process of multiplying and adding with some extra numbers called parameters , and then convert back into text , which will be the therapist 's answer . You just do n't specify what the parameters are that you 're multiplying and adding . Your program will pick the parameters that make it reproduce outputs most like the real therapists 's utterances you have recorded . This is the current state of the art in machine learning and it 's called * deep learning * and the set of parameters the program picks is called a * neural network * . What I just described can give really impressive results especially for making robots communicate with humans , or identify objects that they see . However the \" intelligence \" here is still a set of parameters ( numbers ) which have been picked by a computer to make it perform well on a set of sentences that we gave it . Is this really intelligence ? # 4 .... True AI ? So a neural network is a type of machine learning . Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence . Artificial intelligence that does n't use machine learning would normally be using hand coded rules ( a rule based system ) . Have you ever used Microsoft Excel and fitted a line to a scatter graph ? For example if you plot the height and weight of all the people in your class or work , you can get Excel to draw a line through it . How did Excel find the line ? By picking two numbers , m and c , to make a formula y = mx + c. It picked m and c so that the distance from all the points to the line is as small as possible . The neural network has picked its parameters to make the distance between its simulated answers and the real therapists 's answers , and by doing this was able to simulate a therapist with 100 million parameters . Now if you can answer the question of how to make the step from a set of numbers that essentially fit a scatter plot \u00e0 la Excel , to true intelligence as found in humans , then that is the million dollar question .","Neural networks solve limited problems using data fed into them , they ca n't be given arbitrary novel problems and solve them based on their current state .","Neural networks , especially LSTMs , are definetly one part of what we need for AGI ( or \" true \" AI ) .

File compression is very complex and when describing it to a five year old I would imagine it is indistinguishable from magic . Most compression algorithms work through a combination of methods . One of the most common involve replacing repeated strings of characters with references . Very simplistically : let 's say that within the coding of a particular file the string \" ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ \" occurs 100 times . The compression algorithm will replace all of those instances with a symbol - let 's say \" 1 \" - now everywhere in that file \" ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ \" has been replaced with \" 1 \" - and a table or tree is created with \" 1 \" mapped to \" ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ \" . Now , instead of having \" ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ \" 100 times , you have \" 1 \" 100 times , you save 25 characters worth of space every time , which can add up quickly . This compressed file is saved , and when you go to decompress it , the program runs through the table or tree and replaces all the \" 1\"s with \" ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ \" - decompressing the file and returning it to its original state . There are many other compression algorithms , many much more complex - and even the above is a simplified version of what really happens . Hopefully this gives you a better idea of how they work . The main reason they exist though is because storage space and bandwidth cost money so any time you can reduce the size of a file , especially one you will be moving a lot or sharing over a network , you are essentially saving money .","Let 's look really quick at what a file consists of . In the end , it comes down to a bunch of 0s and 1s arranged in a specific pattern , right ? A zip file is a form of lossless compression so that you can package data up tight , send it somewhere , and then unpack it so that it will be the exact same as the original . Lossless means that you can take data , compress it , then uncompress it , and get the orignal data back . There are things called lossy compression ( MP3 files specifically ) that compress by averaging out sections of numbers . I can go into this more if you 'd like So , let 's say that you have a bunch of M & Ms all in a line . They 're either Red or Blue , and you have millions all going along . You want to send this pattern to a friend so he can make the same sequence and you guys can talk and stuff while you look at your M & M sequences ( just roll with me here ) . Let 's start by looking for patterns . For the sake of simplicity of the scenario , you find 100 different patterns that repeat . Sometimes your patterns overlap , and it 's up to you to decide if the pattern [ R B B B R R B ] is really just one pattern or if it 's a mixup of the [ R B B B ] and [ R R B ] patterns * * * * * . Either way , you have a bunch of patterns all numbered 1 - 100 . So , now you tell him all of the patterns ( you have to say each candy in the pattern so , 100 patterns and we 'll say each pattern on average has 20 candies and the number of the pattern so that 's about 2100 things ) then you tell him the order of the patterns in your sequence ( maybe 10,000 things , which would make 12,100 things to tell him total ) . You were able to tell your friend how to set up your million long pattern by just using 12,100 things ! That 's awesome and saves a ton of time . You can also write down the patterns , and the order and save a lot of paper because you 're not writing a list of millions of things . * * * * * Just to elaborate on this real quick . There are different algorithms to define what a pattern is . Basically , you want each pattern to be as long as possible while still not being too unique ( so that it repeats somewhere else ) .

For example you have a book on your computer that is 20 MB . You want to send that book to a friend . You put it in a ZIP and it becomes 1 MB . You send this ZIP to your friend . The other person receives it , unzips it and he has the 20 MB book . The advantage is that it took 20 times less time to transfer the book ( it was only 1 MB instead of 20 MB ) .

This can mean perf improvements , because the code size is smaller , if instruction cache is a limiter , and it can mean safety \/ debugging improvements , because you always go through the error processing code at the end , ensuring you free resources in all cases ( assuming they use the same variables , a common tactic ): switch(some enum ) { case 1 : dostuff malloc if error goto error ; case 2 : morestuff malloc if error goto error ; case 3 : ... \/\/success : log whatever you like place debugbreak here and be sure you 'll always hit it etc return awesome ; error : do all your error processing here free memory return whatever code you want it 's not only more compact , the more error processing or other finalization code you have , the more adding each new case costs you , and the greater the probability of a bug when you add new things .

A similar phenomenon occurs here . To each person , the other is traveling at near the speed of light . The time of each traveler slows relative to the others frame of reference . To use your example , if both travelers are moving at 0.5 c in opposite directions , each traveler 's rate of time may slow by 50 % relative to the other traveler , so he would only experience 1\/2 second per second ( I hope that makes sense ) . His speed then also changes relative to the other traveler , so each traveler would see himself moving at 0.5 c but see the other traveler moving at only 0.25 c , with a total speed of 0.75 c relative to the other .

Based on our experience of things travelling at the tiniest fractions of the speed of light , we do n't notice these relativistic effects at all . First of all , you have to ask : half the speed of light relative to * what * ? You have to be travelling relative to something ; there 's no absolute speed . How so ? Well , there 's no absolute distance either . You ca n't say , for example , \" I am standing thirty feet away . \" Thirty feet away from * what * ? You can be thirty feet away from me , or thirty feet away from your front door , or thirty feet away from the geographical centre of Wyoming ; but you ca n't be thirty feet away from nothing .

Relative to the sun , then ? No , because the sun is flying around the galaxy . Relative to the galaxy ? But the galaxy is speeding away from all the other galaxies . It was this problem that some scientists were trying to solve , and they thought that if they could detect the effect that the ether had on the speed of light , they would finally get a fix on something that would allow them to say \" speed relative to * this * \" . But they ran into a problem , because no matter how they did it , their instruments always measured the speed of light as being 186,282 miles per second ( in a vacuum ) . What they found , in fact , was this : Suppose I have a flashlight , and we had the means to measure the speed of light coming from the flashlight . I race toward you , with the flashlight on , and I measure the speed of light from the flashlight . I measure it as moving away from me 186,282 miles per second relative to me . You measure the light coming toward you at 186,282 miles per second relative to you . But that does n't make sense : surely you would measure it going faster ? Nope . Exactly the same . So Einstein came up with his theory of relativity , which basically says this : When things move relative to each other , space contracts and time dilates . If I move toward you at half the speed of light relative to , say , a third observer , and you move toward me at the same speed relative to the observer , we would still approach each other at a speed significantly less than the speed of light . For that to work , the neutral observer would notice that we would both appear thinner than normal ( space contracts ) , and our watches would appear to slow down -- because , from his perspective , time for us slows down ( time dilates ) . Basically , the ether does n't exist , so there is no absolute frame of reference .

The rudder 's function is to keep the airplane in * coordinated * flight . To turn the airplane , the pilot rolls the airplane in the direction he \/ she wants to turn by operating the ailerons ( little up \/ down flaps near the wingtips ) . Using the rudder ( which is attached to the vertical stabilizer [ tail ] ) , the pilot keeps the airplane 's nose pointing into the air stream . When the airplane 's nose is pointed directly into the air stream , the apparent force of gravity acts in a direction opposite the angle of bank . In other words , if the pilots rolls the airplane thirty degrees to the right , and coordinates the turn with the rudder , the apparent gravity through the airplane will point directly out of the bottom of the plane at an angle thirty degrees from a vertical line referencing the earth .

So my explanation is actually probably a few years older . So it boils down to how mates are choosen . Or \" sexual selection \" . Sexual selection is similar to natural selection , but where as natural selection picks the individuals that are best acquiring resources and avoiding threats , sexual selection picks the individuals that are best at meeting any kind \" test \" that the female uses to determine who is most fit to mate with . If the female chooses based on first come , first served , then there is little to no \" sexual selection \" going on . In these cases you tend to get big females and small males . This is because big females can make more eggs \/ offspring , and small males reach maturity quicker and go searching for females quicker . In many of the species in which the males are bigger than the females , females typically mate with the male that has successfully dominated all the other males . Over the generations the males that got to mate were the bigger and fiercer ones and they will have bigger and fiercer children . Now the reason the the females do n't just get bigger like their fathers is because the females only face natural selection where as their brothers have to balance both natural selection and sexual selection . A bigger animal has to acquire more food to grow that big and then acquire more food to maintain that extra mass . That means that they are more likely to starve and less likely to find enough food for their young . So at some point it quickly becomes advantageous for females to not acquire as much mass as their fathers and brothers . Basically the root of almost all sexual dimorphism is what kind of and what degree of sexual selection is going on in the species . The less sexual selection going on compared to natural selection , the more similar the sexes are .","animals that claim territory need big males to defend it and animals that are more solitary need big females that defend themselves .","Mammals usually have larger males because males usually need to compete in order mate with females thus evolution dictates that males are larger .

( That 's why we sleep in the first place ) But they also die if they 're not used for too long , so , when you fall asleep , most things shut down , but every hour or so everything pretends you 're awake , so the serotonin receptors do n't die . Every now and again , you remember thinking whatever it is you pretended you were doing while rigid and comatose . Another ( though not mutually exclusive ) theory about dreaming is that , while asleep , your brain makes a sort of virtual reality training ground , so that you can subconciously prepare for lion attacks and such . xmas3fac3x brings up the good point of the potential to harvest large amounds of a drug called \" The Spirit Molecule \" by one of its most famous researchers by slicing up cat brains . I have never heard of it being implicated in sleep or dreaming . Or any other common neural function for that matter , except that large amounts of it are released in the foetal nervous system during the first trimester , it is produced and stored throughout much of life , and is speculated to be released during death . Function unknown . Anyway , tl;dr , when you dream , you use the same parts of your brain as you do when you shower or eat or talk about nothing with your friends . The reason they 're so weird is that your eyes , skin , nose and ears are n't providing any context .","A very valid question . Although dreams and imagination have been linked to an individuals subconscious , there are constraints on further research being conducted in the cause of such . I 'll explain why : During a brain scan of someone immersed in REM sleep , one the most active regions of the brain is the Pineal Gland ( P.G. ) ; a tiny bulb located above the Cerebellum towards the back of the brain . Why is this significant ? Because the P.G. ( often referred to as ' the third eye ' colloquially ) secretes a hormone known as DMT ( dimethyltryptamine ) which is considered one of the most powerful hallucinogens know to man . The best part is that we have a small amount consistently stored in this gland that can be released at specific times . It has been considered that the bright light people claim to experience moments before death is associated with a release of DMT . Which leads me to other circumstances aside from during REM sleep where DMT secretion may occur ; instances of surreal stress ( physically , mentally or otherwise ) , sleep deprivation , extended boredom etc . Boredom may be the likely circumstance that results in DMT 's release , which can result in ' day dreaming ' or ' vivid imagination ' . However , to answer your question ; not enough study has been conducted on DMT and it 's association to bodily response due to it being a class 1 illicit drug .

It was not technically possible to provide continuous tuning over such a wide band , and in any case the mostly empty band space would have provided a frustrating experience . The answer was the \" turret tuner \" which rotated a complete new set of tuned circuits into the RF end of the tuner at each click . The tuned circuits were on individual wafers which snapped into the tuner \" turret \" , and an appropriate , pre - tuned set were provided for each area . By contrast , the fractional bandwidth of the AM radio channels was small , 550 kHz to 1750 kHz , or a 3.2:1 ratio , and many channels were full , particularly after dark , so continuous tuning was technically feasible , and made sense to the consumer . Even then , some early radios provided several pre - settable channels selected by buttons : this was done by mechanically shifting the tuning knob as the button was pressed . For FM the situation is even better : 88 - 108MHz , or a ratio of less than 1.3:1 . A continuous tuning mechanism is simple , reliable , and cheap to make .","My Dad had an old 9 \" TV in the garage with a manual tuner that did not click .

EDIT : The process is called crazing , and is better described as cracks forming on the surface and not really ' air pockets ' . The rest is the same . Many sources also describe that the whitening being due to crystallization . This happens when the polymer strands become stretched in an organized ' crystal ' . The crystalized structure is apparently more opaque than the standard unstrained plastic . There is a lot of conflicting discussion on the internet about it .","By straining the polymer chains ( on the tensile side of bending ) you are causing the chains to increase in order and also increase in crystallinity . It is this increase in crystallinity of the polymer chains that causes the plastic to appear white ( more opaque ) . The crystallinity of the polymers scatters the light . Amorphous polymers will appear more translucent than a crystalline polymer . Crazing is a different phenomena . Crazing takes place at high strains while the increasing crystallinity takes places at comparatively low strain .

When they are all tangled up with no order that are amorphous . If you take an amorphous polymer and add tensile strain ( bending puts one side in tension and the other in compression ) you cause those chains to become more ordered as they tend to become more linear and organized with respect to the tensile strain . As they become more ordered the % crystallinity ( read the wiki link ) increases . This ( semi ) crystalline region scatters light more than amorphous regions so it becomes more opaque ( white ) .

For example , integer arithmetic runs on a different part of the silicon than floating point ( decimal ) arithmetic . A CPU with multiple threads takes advantage of this by letting two programs run on a single CPU core at the same time as long as both programs do n't need to do the same type of instruction at the same time . This is why running two threads on a single core is n't usually a doubling of performance , because if both programs are trying to do integer arithmetic at the same time for example , they need to wait for each other .

Think of each core as an entire Pentium chip . Each core has all of the processing capabilities of that processor , including its cache memory . A multi - core chip takes a bunch of these processing units and puts them on one pice of silicon . In the case of today 's i5 and i7 processors , the cores get \" tied together \" with the highest level cache , which gets shared across all cores . On the other side of this cache is the interface to the rest of the world : the memory controller , the integrated graphics subsystem , and the PICe bus to other devices . A thread , on the other hand , is a * sequence * of instructions . As stated elsewhere , a multi - tasking computer has a LOT of threads running at the same time , and so the cores must * * switch * * between them , mostly depending upon how much time they need . However , this switch is expensive with regards to time because the * state * of one thread must be preserved so that when it gets reinstated , it can start up from where it left off . So , all of the register contents need to be saved along with a lot of invisible state variables . One way to increase performance , then , is to have multiple cores . For an i5 \/ i7 example without multi - threading , simplistically , your threads will run 4x as fast because switching happens 1\/4 as often . ( This is not strictly true because some threads have higher priority , and some threads get * parked * onto a core and do n't get swapped out . ) And now for the meat : With just a few more resources ( silicon ) , we can duplicate a lot of the registers that need to get swapped out during a task switch . This means high - priority threads stop almost instantly and start instantly because the chip has more logical cores . Specifically , since the i5 does not support multithreading , its four physical cores support four simultaneous threads because when switching , it has to go through the save \/ restore cycle . But the i7 , which supports multithreading and has the additional resources turned on , * logically * looks like it has eight cores . Thus , all multi - threaded applications will run faster . ( Not all apps or * threads * can take advantage of multiple cores . ) This is why the 3.5GHz i5 - 6600 K gets a multi - thread CPU Mark of 7983 while the 3.4GHz i7 - 6700 gets 10,035 . But if you look at how fast a single thread on each is , you get 2148 and 2160 because the cores -- when minimizing switching -- are exactly the same .

They can also be seen on supersonic jet engine exhaust plumes .","These are [ shock diamonds ] ( URL_0 ) . Rocket engines are designed to operate in space , where there is no atmosphere , and so the pressure of the gases leaving the engine is lower than the surrounding air . The atmospheric pressure compresses the gases leaving the nozzle ; as this flow is supersonic it creates shock waves , which are made visible by ignition of unburnt fuel . [ This website ] ( URL_1 ) has a more complete explanation .","The SSME 's nozzle runs [ over - expanded ] ( URL_4 ) at sea level , because it 's designed for maximum performance at high altitudes . This means that its exhaust pressure is less than ambient , and so there is an exchange of energy between pressure energy and kinetic energy at and downstream of the nozzle exit plane as the flow tries to sort itself out and achieve equilibrium . Because the flow is supersonic , this exchange takes place via [ shock waves ] ( URL_2 ) . This shock waves produce dramatic local variations in the density of the flow . As the exhaust flow goes through these shock waves , it slows down . This converts some of its kinetic energy into increased pressure energy , which helps it to achieve equilibrium with the atmosphere . However , because of the gas law ( PV = \u03c1RT ) , the rapid increase in pressure drives up the static temperature of the gas ( total temperature is approximately conserved ) . This means that the flow immediately downstream of the shock is both denser and hotter than the flow immediately upstream of the shock . This has a dramatic impact upon how bright it appears to be , because 1 . The amount of light emitted within a given volume of gas obviously depends upon the number of atoms or molecules within that volume , and is therefore proportional to density . 2 . The total radiative power is proportional to the [ fourth power ] ( URL_0 ) of the static temperature of the gas . 3 . The SSME 's exhaust is a mixture of steam and Hydrogen , which mostly emits [ spectral lines ] ( URL_3 ) rather than black body radiation . This means that there is a minimum activation energy to get anything to happen , and so a relatively small increase in the mean static specific energy of the flow may result in a sudden and dramatic increase in radiation . Because LH2 \/ LOX engines produce an exhaust which contains no carbon , the flame has a very low emissivity , and is mostly transparent ( most of the radiation is actually in the UV range ; the red \/ pink tint comes from excess hydrogen in the exhaust , which is there because Isp is maximized by running rich and thereby lowering the mean molecular mass of the flow ) . This means that the Mach disc shows up particularly well . You can get a better idea of just how over - expanded the flow is from [ this image of a test firing . ] ( URL_1 ) Incidentally , if you were wondering why the Delta IV has a much brighter exhaust despite also burning LH2 \/ LOX , the reason is that the [ RS-68 ] ( URL_5 ) uses an ablative nozzle to cut cost . As it ablates , it adds carbon to the exhaust , upping its emissivity , producing a brighter , more yellow , flame . * * tl;dr * * over - expansion of the exhaust produces shock waves , which dramatically change the local static specific enthalpy in some parts of the flow .

The major reason is the transfer of effective sprung weight ( as people here have mentioned ) . Basically , as a car accelerates , the centre of mass is effectively shifted backwards . This means there is more weight over the rear wheels , increasing the normal force between the rear tires and road surface . As frictional force is directly proportional to this ( normal ) force , the rear tires have increased grip under acceleration . The same principles apply with deceleration ( braking ) which is why our main braking system ( brake pedal as opposed to handbrake ) is on the front wheels . Edit : If we were explaining it like we were 25 year olds , the transfer of effective mass is explained by Einstein 's theory of equivalence , that the effects of gravity and acceleration are equatable .

The freehand is a continuous line , the computer version is a series of pixels that are very close to being a continuous line , but are n't quite . At really high resolutions , you ca n't tell the difference between the two lines and similarly , a really good digital amp can come pretty close to the ' clean ' sound of an analog amp . Digital amps are really good at doing other things , however . Digital amps can very easily distort sound because the signal has already been converted into digital and so can be manipulated really easily . The rock of the 90 's tended to use lots of distortion and digital ' solid state ' amps were the amps of choice . In the end , digital amps are now by far the most common type . The signal conversion process has become very good , digital amps are way cheaper and less maintenance , and the features on digital amps let you do way more to change the sound than analog amps could . Still , there are those who are dead set of playing without too many distortion effects and absolutely demand what they feel is the best quality sound . It can be argued that the analog systems are still better for some purposes , and people are willing to spend big money on these amps .","12AX7 and 6v6 tubes driving an amp with lots of big leaky capacitors which then drove speakers that were not made for guitar amps .

Here are the four main reasons : The tl;dr version : 1 . Retirement benefits . The league promised to pay the officials a set amount after they retired . They now want to contribute to a retirement account instead . This would make retirement for the officials more risky and subject to changes in the stock market . 2 . Salary . The officials are currently paid about $ 150,000 a year and want an increase to $ 189,000 per year by 2016 .

There are currently 17 crews ( one for each scheduled game and one alternate ) . The NFL wants to increase that number to 20 crews . The league argues this will increase the quality of officiating and help remove underperforming officials . The officials feel this will reduce their pay . Because their salary comes from a \" pool \" , it necessarily will decrease their individual salaries unless this pool is increased . 4 . Full time officials .

So , if you have three times as many as you need , then you can afford to have 2\/3rds of your subs , silos , and bombers destroyed . In the same respect , nuclear missile defense also lowered the effectiveness of nuclear weapons , causing people to solve he problem by just overwhelming the system with more and more warheads .","There are a lot of reasons for this . One is that it 's not just cities that were target . Missile bases , airfields , bridges , power plants , bunkers , SAM sites ... there are lots of potential targets , depending on your targeting philosophy . The other is about reliability and accuracy . The US Titan II missile had a 9 megaton warhead , and had a circular error probable ( CEP ) of 900 m. That means it had a 50 % chance of landing within 900 m ( 1 X CEP ) of its target , 43 % chance of landing within 1800 m ( 2 X CEP ) , and 7 % chance of landing with 2100 m ( 3 X CEP ) . Let 's imagine , just for kicks , that this weapon would work correctly 100 % of the time . If you needed 200 psi of blast pressure to destroy a point - sized target ( e.g. , something very small relative to 9 megatons ) , the chance that any given Titan II you launch will put that much blast pressure on the target is about 73 % ( this is the \" single shot kill probability \" or SSKP ) . That 's not too bad , but what if the target is _ important _ . How many nukes , then , do you need to launch to get that up to basically 100 % ? The math works out to two Titan IIs . OK , what if the blast pressure we need is 1000 psi , for , say , a hardened , underground silo ? Your SSKP drops to 54 % . That 's a lot lower , but you still only need 2 missiles to get your total probability of kill up to about 100 % . These numbers can change a lot for weapons with different yields ( high yield makes it harder to miss ) , different accuracy ( higher accuracy means you can use lower yields ) , different assumptions about reliability ( in the above calculations , we assumed that 100 % of the Titan IIs we fire will actually behave as expected \u2014 if we drop that number to , say , 90 % , then the probabilities of kill go down ) , and different assumptions about the target ( it gets more complicated if you need to put that amount of pressure down on a larger area , esp . for high pressures and low yields ) . The result is that it 's very easy to have targets that need 4 or 5 nukes per target to guarantee total destruction . ( If your requirements for total destruction are lower \u2014 e.g. 80 % probability \u2014 then the number of nukes decreases . ) Which is just to say \u2014 the assumption of \" one nuke , one target \" is wrong . Typically the assumption is that for some targets , many nukes would be aimed at it , with the assumption that not all of them would destroy it adequately . Combine this with the proliferation of targets in the Cold War plans , and the fact that the services were often not totally coordinated on their plans ( bombers , ICBMs , and SLBMs could be redundantly aimed at the same targets ) , and you end up with absurdities like hundreds of nukes aimed at Moscow alone as late as 1991 . Lastly , when the US had over 30,000 nuclear weapons , a huge percentage of those were tactical nuclear weapons , meant to be used against tanks and troops and bombers in the battlefield , not on \" strategic \" targets like cities or bases or whatever . So those have their own targeting considerations . [ Here 's a quick graph I made ] ( URL_0 ) showing US and Soviet strategic vs. tactical nuke warheads \u2014 the US certainly had a crap ton of strategic weapons ( over 10,000 from 1964 until 1991 ) , but those huge points of the stockpile were because of the bonkers - levels of tactical weapons ( +20,000 ) that they had .

And not all nukes have the same yield or various settings .

And often you will target each location with multiple warheads to ensure the damage gets done .

However , they had to be able to make enough from the stock market to pay off the interest on their debt . For one reason or another , the value of stocks began to drop , and since people had borrowed so much from the banks to invest in the stock market that they tried to sell all of their stocks - they did n't want to end up losing money . However , since everyone wanted to sell their stock , and no one wanted to buy , the price of the stocks continually went down , as people tried to undercut each others ' prices , hoping someone would buy their stocks . Eventually , people could n't pay their debts , so those with money in banks panicked as well and ran to the banks to withdrawal their money from the bank . However the banks did not anticipate this , and did not have enough money on hand to give everyone all the money in their bank accounts . Many banks were forced to close , and those with money in those banks lost everything they had . EDIT : The Federal Reserve was implemented to prevent bank panics as stated above . Basically , if a bank does n't have enough money on hand for a withdrawal they take a loan from the government , and are able to give people their money back , even if the bank is forced to close .","This will be pretty general and unedited as I am at work , but should help . Some of what has been discussed here is true , some is not . Specifically , the Federal Reserve was created before the crash of 1929 by congress in 1913 - The Federal Reserve Act . Through this act congress created a private central bank , aka the Fed , to create and distribute paper currency known as federal reserve notes . In order to create a federal reserve note , congress had \/ has to issue a bond which it then gives to the fed as collateral against the issuance of federal reserve notes . Once printed , these notes are then placed into circulation from the fed to regional banks . Which are then dispersed to your local bank . Now the real problem with the federal reserve came , and still comes from , distribution . Every time a bank note is distributed it is in the form of a loan . A loan the requires interest be repaid to the bank that loaned this note . As such , there has been and always will be more debt than money ie bank notes . To add further fuel to the fire , since the creation of the Fed , banks have be allowed to hypothocate there federal reserve holdings , that is how much money they have , through fractional reserve accounting . That is to say , a regional bank may borrow 100 notes from the Fed at a cost of 101 notes to be repaid . In order to make a profit , the regional bank may now loan out a 110 notes to a local bank and the local bank may loan out 120 notes to you . So as a certain % of the banks depositors never withdraw all of there money , the bank will stay \" solvent . \" That is , they will have enough paper currency to hand out to its depositors . As was previously discussed , in 1929 there was a run on the banks ( for many reason ) . That is investors in the bank , ie you me and anyone else who has a bank account did nt feel their investment was safe and wanted it bank . Unfortunately , there was far more created money , through fractional banking practices , than actual printed money which lead to banks running out of printed money with investors , you & me , still being owed paper notes . As more and more banks ran out of paper notes , more and more people tried to get there notes out of the bank . Ironically , The Great Depression was a deflationary depression directly created by the very institution that was set up to safe guard against . Hope this helps ,","The fed reserve was put in place to 1 ) back up the money supply and to 2 ) set the rate at which banks exchange money . 1 ) Legitimate banks , after the 1930s crash , became FDIC insured ( which you often see all over on stickers inside banks ) . This means that if a bank is to fail , the fed reserve will guarantee a certain amount of the money to each of the bank customers . In the 1930s crash , everyone was trying to pull there money out of their banks at the same time , and the banks did not have enough cash to pay EVERYONE out . Thus , the panic rose among Americans that all of their cash was lost , and even more people wanted to take their money out . Thus , with the government guaranteeing this money , the panic , if there were to be another crash , would not be as monumental . A great movie to watch on this issue it is \" It 's a Wonderful Life \" from 1946 . 2 ) The fed reserve - who holds the money supply - sets the rates at which they exchange money with other banks ( and thus the rate at which banks exchange money between each other , given the fed resrve is setting the value of money ) . In a tight economy , the fed reserve raises interest rates to slow the growth of the economy . The fed , during these times , feels the economy is growing too quickly - possibly creating a large bubble - so they constrict the economy . On the contrary , when the economy is slow during bad times , the fed reserve will lower the interest rates , to encourage borrowing as the cost of borrowing is lower .

States that in the past , males used sexual contact with other males as a way to form \/ strengthen relationships with them .

Although not a simple one . There are a lot of concepts you need to understand . First , you have to understanding conductors , semiconductors , and insulators . Conductors are materials that conduct electricity . Most metals are conductors . Insulators are materials that do not conduct electricity . Most plastics are insulators . As their name suggests , semiconductors are materials that * sometimes * conduct electricity . What determines when a semiconductor conducts electricity ? Great question ! Semiconductors can be \" doped \" to modify their conductivity . Doping is when another material is injected into the semiconductor to change it 's properties . When the injected material contains excess electrons , the resulting material is an n - type semiconductor . The excess electrons are free to float around inside the material . If the injected material contains a lack of electrons , the resulting material is a p - type semiconductor . The p - type semiconductor has \" holes \" where the missing electrons could be . These \" holes \" can move as neighboring electrons fill in the newly created hole , like a game of musical chairs where there is 1 more chair than person . By themselves , p - type and n - type semiconductors are pretty dull . Things get interesting when you put them next to each other , creating a p - n junction . At the meeting point between these materials , something interesting happens . Some of the excess electrons in the n - type material fill the \" holes \" in the p - type material . Because these electrons have moved over , they have altered the balance of charges near the junction , causing a sharp change in the energy level on each side of the junction . When electrons move across this boundary , their energy level changes . The difference in energy is emitted as a photon . By changing the properties of the p - type and n - type semiconductors , the energy difference across the junction ( and therefore the energy level of the photon ) can be controlled . If the photon has the right amount of energy , it is visible to the human eye as light !","The light comes directly from the material which is a semiconductor . inside this semiconductor there are two sides , one with lots of free electrons the other with holes where electrons fit ! If you connect this two sides to a battery electrons start to flow and the magic starts . First you take into account that electrons need energy to move , like everything needs energy to perform motion , then you can think of the atom shells where the electrons sit . You could imagine atoms have stairs and electrons sitting on the lowest steps from the ground up , if you elevate the highest sitting electron to the step above it , you need to push it up ( energy from battery ) but the electron does n't like to sit on a higher step with a gap in between it and the next lower one ! so it false down to it 's original place . And exactly when it falls down it releases it 's additional energy , which it got from the battery or whatever current source , in form of light ( a photon is emitted due to electron - hole recombination ) this happens all the time with multiple electrons and therefor the LED shines . I hope this is readable , I made this post from my phone :-)","Let 's have a try explaining this as easy as possible without using any metaphors ( I do n't think they help much here ) . To create a light emitting diode ( LED ) you use a semiconductor material . Semiconductors have the characteristic of two more or less discrete energy levels for electrons , one being higher than the other one . Between them there is an energetic gap , an energy range in which no electron can be . If you supply the semiconductor with energy electrons are being activated and will use the energy to go into the higher energy level . In general they want to keep the lowest state of energy , so they will \" fall down \" into their lower energy level right after . The difference of energy between those two levels is then emitted in form of light . The color of the light is determined by the material used , as each material has a specific band gap ( difference of energy levels ) which is the cause of the different colors .

For the purposes of this explanation , it 's the flow of any charged atomic particle , such as electrons , or ions in solution . Ions include things like Sodium , potassium , calcium and chloride . The cells in your body that are capable of ' firing ' such as neurons , and muscles , pay a lot of attention to these ions . As you may know , cells are mostly water , and have a membrane surrounding them , made up of fatty acids . Water with ions conducts electric current really well , fatty acids do not . You can think of your cells , as kind of being like a battery , in that they have high levels of potassium ( + ) and chloride ( - ) on the inside of the cell . They actively exclude Sodium ( + ) , and selectively allow calcium(++ ) inside . Cells like neurons , regulate the ratio of ions inside \/ outside , and they try to maintain electroneutrality . Phrased differently , the number of positive charges inside the cell , should equal the number of negative charges inside the cell . If you get electrocuted , suddenly there is a huge amount of negative charge ' outside ' the cells , going into the cells and that really messes up the whole system through some very complicated elecrophysics beyond this discussion . The other major source of more understandable and relatable death and horror , is through resistance . When electricity is flowing through an electrical wire , there is some measure of resistance in that wire . It is usually very low , but there is some mild resistance that becomes significant . If you 've ever touched an insulated electrical wire , or put your hand on an electrical transformer , you 'll notice that it is significantly warm . As electrical current encounters resistance , it generates heat ; just like moving a physical object generates friction ( heat ) , electrical movement generates electrical friction , ergo- heat . The amount of heat is a matter of how much resistance you have , and how much electricity you are trying to move . As an electrical conductor , you are n't that great , and you have a fair amount of resistance . If you have a lot of electricity you 're trying to move ... like say a downed power line , you are going to generate a very large amount of heat , extremely quickly ; and it will literally cook you . If you 're trying to move a much more reasonable amount of electricity , such as licking a nine volt battery , the heat is n't the aspect you notice . You notice your taste bud \/ pain neurons getting annoyed and telling you to stop . Does that help ?","Your neurons use electricity to communicate . If you get shocked , your neurons might treat it as if a signal needed to be sent . So it triggers randomly . Your muscles might tense up in opposite directions , and injure it self . All the neurons firing in your brain is basically a seizure , so if your brain gets shocked all the neurons might fire . Also electricity that is strong enough might burn the things it passes through . This means it might burn the inside of your body .","Electrocution is death caused by electrical current flowing through the body . Electrical current is the movement of charge . So , we need to understand how the movement of charge through the body can kill a human . First , the human body has electrical resistance to the flow of current moving through it . When current flows through a resistor , heat is generated ( this is how heat is generated in an electric stove , or a hairdryer ) . A large enough current flowing through the body will cause substantial burns to the tissue through which the current flows . This in and of itself can kill a person , either directly , when large thermal damage is done to a major organ , like the heart or the brain , or indirectly , when the electrocuted person suffers thermal damage over a large enough portion of their body , resulting in infection and\/or an electrolyte imbalance . Second , both muscles and nerves maintain a electrochemical gradient across their cell membranes . This electrochemical gradient is required for nerves to \" fire \" ( i.e. carry information along a nerve ) and for muscles to contract . Death can occur when current flows through \/ near the heart muscle , disrupting the electrochemical gradient required for normal heart function . The current then causes a heart attack(cessation of the heartbeat , or an irregular heart beat that impairs the ability of the heart to normally pump blood ) . Death can also occur if a large electrical current flows through the brain , causing massive disruption of the normal functioning of the brain , and seizures . A normally functioning brain is required to signal the diaphragm to contract , the mechanism for breathing . A large electrical current though the brain can cause a cessation of breathing , resulting in death by hypoxemia ( insufficient oxygen content in arterial blood ) ."],"1430":["You literally breath it out .

They 're animals so their perception of disgusting is way different from what we 've been taught as humans to find disgusting .","Humans can experience disgust toward things we understand or imagine . That makes our experience of disgust a lot more complex than most animals - your pets can only be disgusted by something that 's right in front of them . It 's a very basic feeling though , and it 's hard to not see the similarity between a grossed - out [ rat 's face ] ( URL_1 ) and a [ child 's ] ( URL_0 ) . Revulsion seems to play two roles in humans . First , like other mammals , it keeps us from eating yucky food - yucky food is more likely to make us sick after all . Second , it is a big part of how we experience belonging to a social group or not . If you do n't like how someone acts but you still feel close to them , you tend to feel angry . But if they \" cross the line \" into actions that are \" unforgivable \" we also feel disgust , maybe even more than anger . If you * really * hate someone , you might even not be angry - you just ca n't stand being with them . It 's * gross . * On a more everyday level , wanting to not be gross is a big motivator for doing the right thing . This is hypothetically why moral codes from the ancient world to the modern use disgust - based symbolism . Everything from \" purifying the unclean \" to \" detoxing one 's system \" - it 's a deep part of human nature . If you 're interested in the complexities of human revulsion , there are a couple of TED talks on the subject , and in - depth research behind them .

The US having troops in the region gives us influence not only in the countries we have troops but also in surrounding countries . Additionally a lot of what the US is doing now is training the militaries on Tactics and procedures so that they are more effective on their own . If the US were to remove all of it 's troops we would have no influence in the region . We would be unable to negotiate from a place of power with countries like Iran and Syria . There would also be a power vacuum left . Countries like Iraq and Afghanistan , as well as others that we have quieter relations with , would struggle to develop their militaries into an effective fighting force against the terrorist groups like ISIS operating in the area . I would estimate that within 12 months the Iraqi government would fail leading to a breeding ground for terrorists . Within 24 months the Afghani government would fail . I say this because Iraq is under a larger more immediate threat , where the Afghani government is in a more drawn out fight that is going to need US guidance over the coming years to develop their military properly . Essentially the entire region , even places that are relatively stable today like Jordan , could become failed states without a strong outside influence giving guidance on how to fight the Guerilla warfare tactics of these terrorist organizations .

As a general term , graduate school is some sort of education beyond the undergraduate . Generally , a specific field ( say , chemical engineering ) is chosen before beginning the program . The programs may last 1 - 6 years or more , depending on the degree , institution , and field . A Master 's degree is sometimes a terminal degree ( meaning that it is the highest degree in a given field ) . The Master of Business Administration ( MBA ) is a terminal degree . The Master in Social Work is also considered a terminal degree , even though there is a Doctorate of Social Work ( though it is uncommon and very specialized ) . Master 's degrees in the sciences are generally not considered terminal degrees , as they are often used as a stepping stone to get a doctorate ( Ph.D. ) . Master 's degrees may be coursework - only or may include a research \/ thesis \/ project aspect . Doctorates ( Ph . D.s ) generally require several years of research and a dissertation in addition to coursework . Depending on the field and institution , this may take anywhere between 3 and 8 years . There are other graduate degrees , for example in law ( JD ) , medicine ( MD ) , dentistry ( DDS ) , education ( EdD ) and others . Each program is specialized and includes the highest level coursework available in that field . The application process is very similar to undergrad . Main differences include : * taking the GRE ( and , if applicable , individual subject GREs ) , LSAT , MCAT , GMAT , or other instead of the SAT * essays topics are limited to professional \/ research experiences EDIT : added more graduate tests","Here is an [ illustrated explanation ] ( URL_0 ) of what graduate school is all about .

For example an expert on a specific drug used in a murder could be hired by the police as a consultant , or a productivity expert might be hired by a company to come in and provide suggestions about ways to increase productivity . Consulting can usually provide a fair bit of income because it requires you to be good \/ an expert in something and as an outside contractor companies tend to hire you to fix problems outside of their normal abilities ( making you valuable to them ) . However this comes at the flip side in demand ; since consultants ' job is basically to fix a specific problem ( and then to leave ) consultants are often looking for new places with that particular problem , so their income can be a bit inconsistent compared to a standard salary job .","Consultant here . :) A consultant is kind of like a plumber You do n't hire a plumber to hang out in your basement fulltime waiting for a drain to clog . Instead , you pay $ 80 \/ hour for them to do the work when you need it .

Consultants work the same way . Instead of having a specialist on staff full time or regular employee half - ass a job they really do n't know how to do , you pay a premium for me to show up , do the job , then leave . The company wins because they are paying less money overall to get the job done at higher quality . I win becasue they can make a lot more money than if I was in a salaried position .

Almost everything runs on , is modeled by , understood using calculus to some extent . Newton 's second law , which is the basis of any kind of physical motion , and so used in all forms of engineering , mechanics , fluids , etc , etc , etc , is an equation in Calculus . The equations that allow us to discuss how electricity will flow , what magnetic fields will do , how light will propagate , are Calculus equations . Even many things in something that may seem like it has nothing to do with Calculus benefit from it , or discrete versions of it , particularly in Computer Science . Your whole world runs on Calculus . If you take advantage of anything invented after 1700 , then you 're more than likely directly benefiting from Calculus . Calculus is an infection . We are in symbiosis with Calculus . Calculus tells us how things change , and everything changes , so we need Calculus for everything .","Finding the volume of solids with sides that can be represented by an equation , like if you have a lathe that can move its cutting bit in and out based on an equation like y = x^2 , you can use calculus to find the volume of the piece of metal you machined with the lathe . You can also find the rate at which a container will fill up if it is both gaining and losing liquid , even if those rates of liquid being added and removed change over time . You can combine the two and find how high the water level would be in a container with radius = height^2 after some time of being filled at a certain rate . Flow of current in electrical circuits is similar to flow of liquids , and can also be calculated with calculus . You can also calculate the force of water exerted on a dam holding water back . The force exerted on each part of the dam changes with the depth of the water , and you can use calculus to sum up all of those forces from depth=0 up to the top of the water level . There are also applications in computer graphics , although there 's probably more trigonometry and algebra than calculus . If you want to draw a curve on the screen , calculus can help you find equations with endpoints and slopes that will match up with each other . Calculus overall in the simplest terms is a set of tools used to work on sums , series , and rates of change . Sums like using the disc method to find the volume of the aforementioned solids machined by a lathe . Series like trying to determine if the sum of N!\/2^N from N=0 up to N=\u221e is infinite or finite ( closely related to rates of change , i.e. which one grows faster as N approaches infinity , 2^N or N ! , is there a limit , does it approach some value ? ) Rates of change are used in sums , like what is the total change in volume of water when two different rates of change are pouring into one container .","A very long time ago I took an accounting class ( because knowing how to keep your books balanced is useful whatever you 're doing with your life ) .

That means sometimes you 'll get stuck in between gears ... past the engine 's sweet spot in one , but not quite in it with the next .

If the Soldier carried a crucial casualty producing weapon , like a machine gun with a higher rate of fire than the standard M4 , it will be given to the next most qualified person along with all the ammo . This is to try and maintain the combat effectiveness , AKA how many bullets you can throw at people , despite having less people . As for the gear , after it is recovered back to a FOB ( Forward Operating Base ) all gear that was worn by a casualty is inspected by people certified to determine whether it is serviceable . If an item is not serviceable and the casualty is still alive the inspectors will make an effort to send the item to the casualty 's home .

In extreme cases they can have blood in their tears . Even without bleeding , the virus is released through all body fluids ( blood , saliva , teats , semen , urine , feces ) . Most of most of the time the clotting problems primarily cause internal bleeding which messes with the salt ( really electrolyte ) and protein balance in the blood , which causes the blood pressure to drop , decreases liver and kidney function , and causes swelling problems . Most people die from low blood pressure rather than direct blood loss . The main thing that affect survival is getting proper medical care early -- before the internal bleeding starts .

English and German are two of the very few languages that use some variation of the word Easter ( or , in German , Ostern ) as a name for this holiday . Most other European languages use one form or another of the Latin name for Easter , Pascha , which is derived from the Hebrew Pesach , meaning Passover . Copy and pasted from someone else 's article about the subject .","[ From the Wikipedia article on Easter :] ( URL_0 ) The modern English term Easter , cognate with modern German Ostern , developed from the Old English word \u0112astre or \u0112ostre . This is generally held to have originally referred to the name of an Anglo - Saxon goddess , \u0112ostre , a form of the widely attested Indo - European dawn goddess . In Greek and Latin , the Christian celebration was and is called \u03a0\u03ac\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1 , Pascha , words derived , through Aramaic , from the Hebrew term Pesach ( \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7 ) , known in English as Passover , which originally denoted the Jewish festival commemorating the story of the Exodus . Already in the 50s of the 1st century , Paul , writing from Ephesus to the Christians in Corinth , applied the term to Christ , and it is unlikely that the Ephesian and Corinthian Christians were the first to hear Exodus 12 interpreted as speaking about the death of Jesus , not just about the Jewish Passover ritual .

Additionally , internet chats and texting have turned out to be ripe fields for linguistic play , so while I think our high volume of writing will have * an * effect , I 'm not convinced its effect will be to measurably slow down the evolution of the language .

For funsies , [ here 's a guy ] ( URL_0 ) who posited what English could sound like in the future .","I do n't think anyone really knows for sure . However : I think it would be a very , very long time . We live in a strange age . Adult literacy is much higher than it was 100 years ago , or even 50 years ago . We are increasingly moving to written forms of communication . If you go back to before Shakespeare 's time the written word was primarily used for record keeping . Stories were written down , but you would n't normally read them for pleasure , but read them out loud as entertainment . But now books and plays and tweets and reddit are written for everyone . The result is that the language has n't really changed that much . Whereas Chaucer ( 200 years before Shakespeare ) is almost impossible to a modern audience , Shakespeare and his contemporaries are quite understandable to a modern audience . And English has been standardised even more since then . Even in my lifetime I 've seen words which had different meanings in different places ( no - one uses the British billion any more ) become standardised , we 're increasingly using American spellings for things ( the British \" sceptic \" has fallen out of use , in favour of the American \" skeptic \" , with many British publishers preferring the second one ) . As we continue to be a society that communicates by writing , so we will continue to read and understand the writing of those before us , and the evolution of the language will slow down . There will be new vocabulary in the future that gets introduced , or old words that take on new meanings . ( \" Computer \" used to be a person whose job it was to calculate numbers . ) There will be new slang , and some old slang will fall out of fashion . There will be new concepts which need words to describe them .

So there 's my predictions : in 1000 years they 'll still be reading Harry Potter , and we 'll still be able to understand them ( mostly ) , because the globalisation and the universal usage of written English has caused it to be standardised , and standardisation means the language evolves more slowly .","We ca n't say because we 've never really had the sort of communication and recording technology we have in modern times .

Economically , there were fewer incentives for banks to behave responsibly post - deregulation . Seen in thus light , housing bubble was the context for the failure , but not the cause .","I usually do n't do this , but this video explains this perfectly . [ The Crisis of Credit Visualized by Jonathon Jarvis ] ( URL_0 )","I 'm really tired but i 'll take a stab : Towards the GFC , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became more heavily involved in the securitization of residential mortgages , specifically Mortgage backed securities ( a security is an asset of any kind , e.g. shares , bonds etc ) . Basically these come about from banks giving loans out to people , those loans are now considered to be assets by banks , and instead of holding the loan to it 's full term and collecting their principal + interest payments after 15 years or so , they decide to have that mortgage chopped up and sold in the form of Mortgage Backed Securities . So as an example ; say my friend owes me $ 50 bucks in 2 weeks after i loaned him $ 30 today , but i want the money right now to give out another loan to another friend . I organize with 5 other friends for them to pay me $ 8 each right now for the loan , so i end up with 40 bucks , a $ 10 profit instead of $ 20 , but i take that loss because of the time value of money ( $ 40 today may be worth more to me than $ 50 in 2 weeks ) . My friends all get their equal shares of the loan , and in 2 weeks time my friend pays back the $ 50 he owes , not to me but to my friends because they purchased the loan from me . So my friends who originally paid me $ 8 each have now all made a profit of $ 2 each because they received the $ 50 and split it 5 ways , just like they paid for it split 5 ways at $ 8 a piece . Everybody wins ( so far ) . Though that is a really simplistic idea , that is an example of how a bank can bundle up a bunch of mortgages , chop them all up and sell them in security form to ordinary investors or investment banks ( who at the same time , thanks to deregulation have now started to act more like hedge funds , where they are now buying and selling securities as themselves to try and make money , instead of facilitating the trade between two parties like they used to do ) . These investors hope to make a profit when the mortgage holder pays the money they owe + interest , hence why it is known as a * mortgage backed * security , the security is backed by the underlying asset of the mortgage . Now let 's go back to the idea i mentioned before ; what are the ramifications of me being able to do that deal with my friends , where i sold my $ 50 owed for a quick $ 40 ? - Well , the primary ramification is that i have shrugged off most of the risk ( or so i thought ) . Turns out that this is a pretty sweet deal , i can just give out a loan to somebody with little regard of whether they can pay me back or not , because i 'm just going to offload the asset anyway for some quick cash and then It 's somebody else 's problem . So i decide to go out and give loans to every single one of family members , and even some random people i just met on the street . Can they all pay me back ? Probably not but who cares , because i 'm going to once again go to my friends and this time offer them the $ 5000 I 've managed to accumulate in money owed to me in 6 months , for a cool $ 4000 right now . I take the 4 grand and they take the asset that is soon to be worth 5 grand . - Eventually they figure out that the asset is compromised , and is going to collapse at a later date , and it is in fact not worth 5 grand in 6 months , it 's worth $ 200 , because only $ 200 is going to be paid back . However , for now It 's still priced at 5 grand in 6 months , so my friends decide to hold this asset for * one month * , just long enough for the asset to now be worth 4166.67 ( 1000\/6 months = $ 166.67 additional time value per month ) . They pass the asset on to some poor idiot for the price of $ 4166.67 and make a profit of $ 166.67 because they paid $ 4000 for it originally . Eventually the guy that purchased it for $ 4166.67 also figures this out and sells it to somebody else , and it goes on and on and on . * * This is what happened with mortgage backed securities , everybody knew that at some point between now and ( for example 5 years ) from now the security wo n't be worth shit , but for now you can make a quick profit by playing hot potato with it and hoping you 're not the guy holding it when the mortgages ( the underlying assets ) begin to default * * What did this mean for the housing market ? Well , just like i was able to shrug off the risk in the above example , the banks could do the same . This gave them incentives to give out more and more loans to lower income people . Since everybody that attains a mortgage buys the same thing with it ; a house , the demand for housing goes up and up and up and up and * up * , causing a housing bubble . The supply of housing is n't getting any larger , but the demand * * is * * getting larger because more people can now afford their own slice of the american dream thanks to the financial system ( or so they thought at the time ) . Prices on a market are always determined by supply and demand , as long as demand > supply it will always grow in price until demand = supply or demand < supply , or the government imposes price controls , but that has historically made things far worse . [ This is known as the law of demand ] ( URL_0 ) So this is where we are at this point : - Too many people can get a loan to buy a house , too few can pay their loan back . - Housing is currently very overvalued for the above reason - The Banks have decided to offload stacks of these loans for quick cash , spreading the risk around . So now , when the loans go bad all the investors and financial institutions that got on board with the mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) will get burned , hard . - Additionally , a lot of these MBS have been given credit ratings that did not accurately represent their relative instability . So what happens when the bubble pops ? Lots of people default at the same time . - Demand is no longer greater than supply , because too many people lose their homes when they default . - When supply is greater than demand , the price of housing drops , and it dropped to a fraction of what its price was during the bubble - Market goes into a panic , people realise these securities are worth jack shit , and struggle to offload them because there are not enough buyers to meet the sellers of these securities ( because they are shit , and people have realized now ) . The price of the securities drops and drops and drops until the securities are worth close to nothing , big financial institutions and banks that had huge investments in these MBS get financially annihilated , though obviously this was n't the only contributing factor . - The banks need a bailout , because they lack the liquidity to pay their short term liabilities and debts they owe to other financial institutions ( they all owe each other money , and none of them can pay each other back ) . - Lehman brothers goes bankrupt , because they did n't get liquidity fast enough from the government and Barclays was n't allowed to take them over . - Banks refuse to give out loans to businesses until they are stable again after the bailout , the economy is really unpredictable right now and they are just focused on surviving the winter as opposed to making a profit from giving out loans , because if these businesses they loaned to were to also default it would be all over for everybody . - Because banks refuse to give out loans , businesses now can not expand because they are hugely dependent on credit to make large expansion plans and to hedge their risk , so the economy stops growing . Job growth stagnates because no new jobs are being created from expansion , businesses have had to start laying people off because revenues are shit 'cause everyone 's broke . There 's a lot more to it , e.g. - Bonus culture , bankers get a bonus based on how many loans they give out \/ transactions they settle etc etc , the success later on down the track is irrelevant , they get paid the same bonus anyway . - Deregulation allowed investment banks to get seriously into prop trading , as it became more profitable to prop trade than to do what investment banks traditionally did , such as advising on mergers and acquisitions ( investment banking ) . They took on huge risks through derivative trades and just being generally unethical when it came to facilitating trades for clients vs making their own trades themselves , where there were some serious conflicts of interest . - Due to a lack of regulation banks also lack the liquidity needed to really be safe from the possibility of a default , many other countries such as Australia enforce minimum capital adequacy and liquidity requirements , so if anything were to happen they would n't require a bailout ."],"8909":["Time is a measurement based on the scale in which humans live and die .

Yeah the whole idea of everything moving towards disorder and decay is very poetic and somewhat based in a scientific principle , but firstly that 's the 2nd law of thermodynamics , not a definition of entropy , and secondly I 'm pretty sure a junior engineering student is aware of that simplification and looking for something a little more scientifically rigorous . Disorder is one definition , but a somewhat ambiguous and debated term these days . It makes it easy to grasp at first , but as you learn more can lead to some confusion and the kinds of misinformation I 'm seeing here . Granted I 'm no expert either , but here 's my take : Entropy you can consider a sort of measure of how easily or impossibly reversible a process is . For a more tangible example : an object falling from a higher place to a low place is a relatively small change of entropy . Assuming the system as simply the object , you need to input energy into the system ( pick it up ) to restore it to it 's old state but that 's pretty easy . Let 's say the object cracks during the fall . Well the change in entropy just got a little higher because you got ta do some more work ( input more energy ) to mend that crack . Now say the object shatters into a hundred pieces , it will be even harder to restore it . You 'll have to work to pick up all the pieces , rearrange them back to their original state , and then somehow bind them back together . Thus that 's a much higher change of entropy . And so on .. In physics this concept is important because things naturally want to go to a state of higher entropy ( 2nd law thermodynamics ) , enough so that it can happen spontaneously without outside input . This is what drives so many things , like heat flowing for hot areas to cold areas or pressure gradients in a system tending to equalize or dispersal of particles . Entropy is how you describe that change . In a closed system , if ice melts in water , the ice got warmer but the water got colder , and the total heat \/ energy in the system is the same ( ignoring heat of fusion ) . In a closed system , if a bunch of grouped together particles dissipate and spread out , the overall mass \/ density of that system is still the same . So what changed ? And that 's where the concept of entropy comes in as a measure of that change . Um , so that 's more the classical definition . The concept has evolved beyond just physics and I think the definition then really depends on the application .","It 's just probability . Consider all the possible outcomes of tossing a hundred coins , and make a histogram for number - of - heads .

This even applies to negative numbers . -1 x -1 = 1 , -2 x -2 = 4 , -3.48 x -3.48 = 12.1104 . This is probably best visualized on a number line , but I 'm going to skip that since your question is n't about multiplying negative numbers . An imaginary number pretends that it 's possible to have a number that is the result of multiplying a number by itself but getting a * negative * number as a result . * i * is used to indicate imaginary , and * i * works like this : * i * x * i * = -1 If you 're familiar with square roots , those are numbers which , when multiplied by itself , give you a given number . For instance , the square root of 4 is 2 . It 's the same problem as 2 x 2 = 4 , but in reverse . In fact , the square root of 4 can be one of two numbers : 2 or -2 . Sometimes only one number matters ( if you 're measuring something in the physical world ) , but sometimes both numbers matter ( if you 're solving an advanced equation ) . It 's written with a symbol : \u221a4 So : \u221a4 = 2 and \u221a4 = -2 or \u221a4 = \u00b12 * i * can be written as : \u221a-1 = * \u00b1i * So far , as you imply , this sounds like something abstract that would n't have much real - world useage . For examples of real world applications , I 'm going to hand you off to someone who explains it step by step .

But try two do the same for 1 - 2 = ? . Now that 's different : How could you possibly give two legos to me if you only have one yourself ? A long time ago , somewhere in Europe , someone decided that it would be nice to still be able to give an answer to 1 - 2 = ? and they said \" well , the answer to the * negative * problem is 1 , so we 'll call the answer to this problem * negative * 1 \" . It 's just a made up thing that makes it possible to write down an answer for some problems . We can interpret it as debt , for example , but that 's just an added bonus . Negative numbers * do not exist * , if you think about it . A similar problem occurs when you think about the root of numbers . The square root of 4 is 2 and -2 . That means 2 * 2 = ( -2 ) * ( -2 ) = 4 . But what is the root of -4 ? There was no such number ! But then , someone , not so long ago , * invented * a \" number \" , and called it * i * , and said \" well , this number is the solution to Sqrt[-1 ] = ? . That is why it is called imaginary , because it is just made up . But just like the negative numbers , it is useful because without it many problems would be impossible to solve . To give you a real world example is much more difficult , because we 'd have to get into the geometry of imaginary numbers for that - They are perfect for calculating rotations and stuff like that .","Imaginary numbers are anything but imaginary - they definitely exist in math , and they show up all over in physics ( especially quantum mechanics , which ca n't work without them - quantum is responsible for making your computer work ) Let 's start with the number line , and say we have some number . What happens when you multiply that number by another one ? You \" stretch \" away from 0 if the second number is bigger than 1 or less than -1 , and you \" squish \" towards 0 if the second number is smaller than 1 and bigger than -1 . You can also flip which side of 0 you 're on if the second number is negative . So we 'll think of multiplication by a real number as a stretch or squish and maybe a flip . Now imagine a big sheet . It goes on forever in all directions . Let 's pick a point on this sheet and call it a \" complex number . \" Now I can label the point by two real numbers - how far to the right \/ left of 0 I am and how far above \/ below 0 I am . These are the \" real \" and \" imaginary \" parts . The thing that makes these complex numbers different from just a pair of real numbers is that you can * multiply * them in a really cool way . When you multiply our complex number by another complex number , it both squishes \/ stretches the number towards \/ away from 0 and * rotates * where the number is . So remember how -1 \" flipped \" a real number ? We can think of that instead as taking our number and rotating it half a circle around 0 . Real numbers are stuck on a line , so the only rotations you can get from multiplying by real numbers are 0 and half a circle . But with complex numbers you can get any rotation you like ! And they 're really easy to manipulate , too . If you multiply a ton of different complex numbers together and want to know the result you just add up all the rotation angles and multiply all the ( real ) stretches and squishes . Now , you say , what 's this got to do with square roots ? That 's where you hear about imaginary numbers ! Well , the imaginary number i is a rotation by 90 degrees ( a quarter circle ) with a stretch \/ shrink of 1 ( no stretching ) . What happens if you take i x i ? I said you multiply the stretches and add the rotations , so you get a stretch of 1 x 1 = 1 and a rotation of 90 + 90 = 180 degrees . But remember , we just realized that we can think of -1 as a rotation by 180 degrees with no stretch ... So i x i = -1 . This means that i is a square root of -1 ."],"10729":["Cars today have , on average , better fuel economy than they did 20 years ago . The improvement is n't as dramatic as you might expect because they 've had to increase weight to meet modern safety standards .","Safety features and crash protection required these days ends up adding mass to a vehicle .

The long version : There is no fundamental difference . The two words refer to broadly the same concept . The only gotcha is that different people use different names and different notation . The most common thing I see in informal contexts is , I think , \" There 's an x in y chance this will happen \" . E.g. \" There 's a 1 in 6 chance you 'll roll a six on a die . \" In a mathematical context , you 'll almost always call it \" probability \" , and represent it as a single number : Either a percentage ( usually for laypeople ) \" There 's a 16.6(6)% probability of rolling a six on a die \" , or as a number from 0 to 1 ( in more technical contexts ): \" There 's a probability of 1\/6 of rolling a six on a die \" . Note how I did n't write a probability of 0.1666 ( equivalent to the percentage ) . Mathematicians are a precise bunch , and nobody would say a probability of 0.16 when you can write it precisely as 1\/6 . Finally , odds is a term most often used in gambling or by gamblers , and usually comes in the form of a ratio , in the form failures : successes , so e.g. \" 5:1 odds against rolling a six on a die \" \u2014 five failures ( 1,2,3,4,5 ) to one success ( 6 ) . The gotcha here is that odds in this sense is often used interchangeably with the odds in a bookmaking sense : the payout . 5:1 odds means that , on a bet of $ 10 , you win $ 50 ( so take home $ 60 ) . Because the house wants to make money , the ( payout ) odds are usually worse than the ( probability ) odds : Rolling a six might be a 5:1 event , but it 'll earn you 4.9:1 from a bookkeeper .","Odds are always expressed as a ratio , whereas probability is usually a percentage . The probability of event A happening is 25 % but its odds are 1 in 4 . When you 're just talking it makes little difference which you use , \" probability is n't good . \" \" The odds are n't great , \" but when it comes to actual figures , probability is usually percentage , odds are a ratio .","Note that there are two ways of describing odds , which are not the same . One being \" one * to * four \" and the other being \" one * in * four . \" Colon notion is usually \" one to four . \" Probability is a fraction , often expressed as a percentage . So the probability of something is 1\/4 , or 25 % . This percentage represents the fraction of times you would expect to see an event occur , if you were to repeat the conditions a large number of times . A fraction has two parts : A numerator and a denominator . In the fraction 1\/4 , the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 4 . If the odds for something is one - in - four , then the probability is just the same fraction as the odds are expression . One is four = 1\/4 = 25 % . If the odds are 1:4 , this means that if you expect to see the event occur once for every four times you fail to see it ( on average over time ) . If you were to convert this to a probability fraction , the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 1 + 4=5 .

We are taught to think of vectors when taking turns . The airplane will generate more lift by flying straight and level and upright -- so think of an arrow pointing upward from the floor of the airplane representing its direction of lift . You can do things to make it longer , to generate more lift . You can use speed and deflection and adjust the wing chord . As you turn , you will always lose lift and the vertical component drops . So , we increase our angle of attack to maintain altitude . At a 30 degree bank , we have to pull bank as well as maintain the turn to keep level . At 60 degrees bank , you feel close to or around 2 G 's continuously . As you near 90 degrees bank , the airplane would not physically or mathematically be able to increase its lift enough to fly perfectly level . It is possible to use yaw to hold onto some lift , but even that wears off . It is possible to appear level and complete a major arc at 90 degrees , losing only a small amount of altitude , but it requires significant speed . The gravity vector pulls only so much , and so long as the bank does n't exceed 90 degrees , the aircraft can use maximum lift and maximum G 's to render the gravity vector negligible for the purpose of a 5 second maneuver . No physical way to hold it much longer unless you have jet engines and a structurally powerful aircraft and a G suit .","URL_1 you mean like that right ?

Firstly , it might actually be falling . But it is moving quite fast , so that falling might not be obvious immediately . It might be doing a tight turn , pulling 4 + Gs , and the small amount that the plane 's wings are off the vertical is enough to balance gravity . Lastly , the a plane can get lift from the body structure , the ' vertical ' ( now horizontal ) rudder , and from the propeller , if the plane is pointing slightly upward . Most likely , it is doing a bit of all three , allowing it to fly with the wings pointing toward the ground ."],"6927":["Sometimes , they are just regular server hardware , connected via ethernet - the same cable that you use to connect a PC to the internet if you do n't use wireless .

The problems are : 1 ) they are expensive 2 ) fast charging puts a lot of strain on the battery and this reduces the lifespan , which is bad for consumer electronics at large 3 ) balancing multiple cells becomes more difficult as you charge faster , 4 ) the logistics of it , i.e. the charger \/ charging circuitry Battery technology totally exists today that would allow you to fully charge your phone \/ laptop \/ tablet in 15 minutes .

Noawadays the name public house means a building owned by a brewery , run by a tenant , for the sale and consumption of alcohol . In UK law you must have a license to sell alcohol , a license to have it consumed on your ( public commercial ) premises and another personal license to facilitate this sale . A pub in the UK is owned by the brewery . They have a tenant that buys the business within the building and then gets to keep the profit made from the sale in exchange for meeting the brewery 's minimum sale requirements . They must buy beer from the brewery and if they do n't buy enough they will be kicked out and another tenant will be found . This leads to , in more recent times , more pubs shutting down due to the aggressive nature of breweries . However you can also have free houses ( woohoo ) which are owned and run by the same person .

Bars are more aimed at limiting the bar area to sale only , once you have your drink you leave and go back to your private area and socialise mainly with those that you came out with . Pubs will often provide entertainment such as music , darts , snooker and\/or pool , with snacks and occasionally food served too . Bars also open different hours to pubs . Because pubs are a social location , in the UK at least many pubs open earlier in the day than bars , sometimes noon , but quite often around 4 pm I have found . Bars are more aimed at night time and weekend rushes and are a more commercial location","I was always under the impression a \" bar \" is a feature ( usually a counter ) in an establishment that serves it 's specialty .

So you use it to cut up a grain of salt . How small could you get ? Could you just cut it up forever , into ever tinier and tinier pieces ? If we cut up salt , we 're going to get tinier and tinier pieces . But eventually we get down to one piece that is so small ( too small to actually see ) that if we cut it up , it is n't really salt any more . That one piece of salt is what we call a * molecule * , and it is made up of one * atom * each of two different natural substances ... sodium and chlorine ( NaCl ) . Sodium and chlorine by themselves are n't really anything like salt . It 's only when they are combined in that particular way that we get the stuff we call salt . They each have very particular properties when they are on their own , and are quite different than salt . For example , chlorine tends to make a poisonous gas ! And if you throw a big chunk of pure sodium into water , look out ... it will probably explode . But put the two things together and it makes common table salt , which we eat all the time . Weird , huh ? We used to think that atoms were the smallest possible things . It turns out , that 's not quite true . In nature it mostly is , but people have come up with ways to figure out what makes up atoms , and even to separate them . If you could cut up those atoms even further , you 'd get stuff like protons , neutrons , and electrons . Most atoms are made of those three things , but the numbers of each is what gives the different atoms their properties . So we get stuff like gold , or helium , or iron just from the combination of different numbers of protons , neutrons and electrons . * * EDIT * * : How many atoms are in a grain of salt ? Around 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 . That 's one quantillion , or a billion billion .","Think of atoms as letters of the alphabet , where each element is a different letter .

So both of these expressions are undefined , technically . However , in the context of limits ( I 'll explain in a second ) when things look like they 're going to x\/0 or 0\/0 we do different things . To start , a limit is simply explained as what does a function look like its doing as we get close to a point . We typically introduce limits by picking points closer and closer to a value and see where these results looks like they 're going . So , we want to know what 's going on around x = 1 of the function ( x^2 - 1)\/(x-1 ) . We try to plug in x = 1 but we quickly realize that we see 0\/0 . So we pick the point 0.9 and plug it in then 0.99 and 0.999 and numbers closer and closer to 1 . Then we point 1.1 and 1.01 and 1.001 and number closer and closer to 1 from the other direction and get this table x f(x ) 0.9 1.9 0.99 1.99 0.999 1.999 1 0\/0 ? ? ? 1.001 2.001 1.01 2.01 1.1 2.1 and we can easily see that in this case 0\/0 meant 2 . In another case : ( x^2 + x - 6)\/(x^2 - x -2 ) as we get close to 2 . Well , plugging in x = 2 gives us 0\/0 again . But a table analysis like above will tell use that this is really 1.666 Yet another case : ( e^x -x -1)\/x^2 as x gets close to 0 . Plugging in 0 tells us 0\/0 . But a table analysis ( taking a limit ) tells us 0.5 So 0\/0 can really mean anything ! ---- Alternatively , let 's look at things that end up as x\/0 . First example is ( x^2 ) \/(x-2 ) as we get closer to 2 . We try to plug in 2 and we get 4\/0 . Let 's do a table : x f(x ) 1.9 -36.1 1.99 -396.01 1.999 -3996 Things are going way off to negative infinity ! Let 's try the other direction : x f(x ) 2.1 44.1 2.01 404.01 2.001 4004 Things are going way off to the positive infinity ! Okay ... maybe it was a fluke . Let 's try another limit of the form x\/0 : say ... 2\/(e^x -1 ) as we get close to x=0 . Plugging in x = 0 tells us 2\/0 . Right form . But building a table gives us infinities again ! So , we can see from a few examples here that x\/0 means infinities , while 0\/0 can mean anything . So , we call one of them undefined ( or really infinite ) and the other we call indeterminate because it can be anything , we just do n't know what . ( There are advanced ways of determining the \" what \" without building a table , but this should convey the point . ) ---- But really , what does all this mean ? Why do we care about limits ? Well , limits are the foundation for modern calculus . They can explain how rockets fly , how fireworks explode , nuclear reactors , electrical circuits , and many many more things . ---- TL;DR : This deals with the calculus topics of limits . Which is the question \" what happens when we get close to _ _ _ _ _ \" . And if it looks like x\/0 then we get an infinity ( undefined ) and if looks like 0\/0 we can get anything ( undetermined ) .","NOPE it does not have to do with limits . 1 ) X\/0 ( remind to add x ! = 0 though ) is undefined because there 's not any numbers which multiplied to 0 gives us X. In other words A \/ B = C means that C*B = A. Let 's try now with X\/0 ( with X ! = 0 ): X \/ 0 = C BUT there is not any number that satisfy : C * 0 = X. therefore X\/0 ( with X!=0 ) has no solutions . 2 ) this one case is very similar : 0\/0 is equal to any numbers because : 0\/0 = C it 's equal to say that C*0 = 0 , and this is true for EVERY value of C no matter which one . That it is the real explanation .","first , the case of x\/0 ... make x=1 . 1\/1 = 1 , 1\/.5 = 2 , 1\/.25 = 4 . as the denominator get arbitrarily close to zero , the answer becomes infinitely large , so large that we can not define it 0\/0 = x ... x can be literally any number , if you multiply it by 0 you get 0 , so what x is is indeterminable"],"8937":["Could that smell possibly be mildew ?

We animals mostly get ours from plants , but plants get theirs straight from the air- in the form of carbon dioxide . To make those carbon atoms useful for making skin , organs , roots , leaves , and whatever else , it needs to be bonded with other elements- most of the time with just a few , and most commonly hydrogen . This bonding takes a lot of energy- it 's why you gain less weight than the weight of all your food put together . When you 're growing quite a bit of your energy is spent just putting those atoms together . Plants have done a lot of this carbon construction throughout the history of the world . A bunch of those plants have ended up as coal- which , even though it does n't look like it , is still made up of all those complex carbon compounds the plants spent their whole lives building . When you add enough heat , those bonds start to break , and all the energy that went into making them is released , all at once . That 's fire !

The Fourier Series allows you to express and communicate arbitrary information using the the rubber circle stamp of the electronics world : the sine wave . Added bonus , once information is translated into a sum of sine waves it can be transmitted , stored , and processed very easily . In fact you can use this for compression .

And just like we took * * two * * 4s and * * three * * 1s , we add those sines and cosines with different * weights * or * coefficients * .

Something like 30 % of our health spending is pure waste . Well , worse than pure waste because of the risk of negative outcomes ( hospital acquired infections , death , etc . ) . This can be from all kinds of things , from outright fraud to doctors and systems simply covering their butts , to doctors agreeing to treatments that patients asked for so they do n't lose their future business . If you understand supply \/ demand models , I hope that you know a bit about price sensitivity . There is an assumption of a downward sloping demand for healthcare services with respect to price paid ( higher cost - > less demand for it ) . The trouble is that the payor is not the same as the recipient of the service , and neither is the one who makes the recommendation . Here , the one that recommends the treatment is often the one who gets paid for doing things ( the doc ) , the one who pays often just gets a bill for what has been done ( the insurer ) , and the one who receives the service ( the patient ) just pays their copay - a cost that has little to do with the total price of the service . A huge driver of costs is the \" arms race \" of the latest technology . This has all kinds of drivers that are worth diving into - like our current patent and approvals process - but I 'll leave that for the inevitable flood of comments . The consequence is that doctors and health system spend a massive amount of money on new technology that patients demand that has little ( if any ) positive effect on outcomes . In terms of market structure , there is massive fragmentation among providers . And they are the ones who have to buy supplies . Since there is n't one big purchaser of supplies ( including meds , devices , durable medical supplies , etc . ) and there are just a few major players for specialized ( and patented ) supplies , the providers have little bargaining power to keep costs of supplies down . The higher costs from less market power get passed on to customers . Additionally , consumers - patients - do n't have any real power , except through their insurers , to keep costs down . ( But if there exists a patients ' union , let me know ! ) Finally , regulation . It costs a lot of money to comply with all of the regulations . This goes from staffing ( doctor training is massively expensive and heavily regulated ) , to job designation ( there is generally a very well - defined scope where an individual can practice ) , to required emergency care ( see EMTALA ) driving up the cost of bad debts , and even to requirements related to safety . These all cost a lot of money , and those costs all get factored in when the providers set their prices . With the general price insensitivity , and lack of customer power , these costs generally go straight through to increase the cost of care .

A stack is a way of organizing memory such that the program sets one piece of data above the previous one , the next above that , etc . It normally refers to a specific stack , though . Each program has multiple areas of memory it can draw from , each with its own purpose . One is just called the \" stack \" . Usually that 's what a stack overflow is referring to . The stack is used for local memory . When a program jumps to a new piece of code that it wants to run , it allocates a chunk of memory on top of the stack to use as local memory . This is called a function call . Calling another function will use a chunk of memory further up , so that local memory is never overwritten by another function call ( there are exceptions , but that 's not important here ) . When the program returns from a function , it releases the allocated local memory . One common problem is if a badly coded function always calls itself before returning . What you get is more and more memory allocated on the stack until there is no more . edit : clarity","ELI5 version : Stack overflow . It 's like writing on a single a4 page and running out of room . The paper is the stack . There is too much writing for the space , it 's overflown . That 's it . Another analogy could be a dam and water . The dam is the stack , the water is the information .

When you 're running a program , each time you do something you 're sending a request to the system . The system takes these requests and puts them into a pile or a \" stack \" and then proceeds to address each request in a specific order .

So the current is what is important , the voltage determines if the current is strong enough to make it all the way through the device .","Resistance is how difficult it is for power to pass through a conductor . Resistance is voltage divided by current . In a computer , if you set the voltage a tiny bit too high , you get more resistance than necessary which means more heat .

If you set it even higher , the potential is high enough that it can jump through the air to places it 's not supposed to be .

Otherwise , erratic or damaging effects can occur .","Voltage determines how much current will flow through the circuit . The fundamental relationship between Current ( I ) , Voltage ( V ) , and Resistance ( R ) is V = IR .

Some of them are related to physics ; ie the electrical characteristics of the atmosphere allows the AM radio waves to propagate much better at night than they do during the day . AM Radio Stations in major cities also use hugely powerful transmitters ( 50,000 Watts is the FCC maximum ) . The energy of an electromagnetic wave diminished with the inverse square of the distance from the source ( the further you are the weaker the signal is ) - but when the signal starts out * really * powerful , it can go much farther before it is undetectable . One other factor is that the regulator that controls radio and TV stations in the US , the FCC , issues a few \" Clear Channel \" licenses ( you may have heard of Clear Channel Communications - this is where the name comes from ) to radio stations . Certain stations have , theoretically , exclusive use of the airwaves at night ( for their frequency band ) - this means that there is no interference from other stations on that frequency , so it can be heard much farther away than it might otherwise be .","Most radio is line - of - sight ( LOS ) or very close to it , meaning that unless you 're fairly close to the transmitter you ca n't receive the signal . You definitely ca n't get most signals whose source is beyond the horizon from your location . At night , the ionosphere of the earth is stronger and more present . The signals used for AM radio are reflected by the ionosphere , so at night , they travel from their source , hit the ionosphere high in the sky , then bounce back to earth , and reflect back up , then down , and so forth . This effect is called a \" skywave \" and it 's what allows your radio to get Chicago from Atlanta . It can happen during the day , but it 's much less likely .

The home study process itself can take a very long time and can be expensive . The average in our area MD \/ DC \/ VA is about $ 2,000 for the home study and that does n't include paying for required paperwork checks such as the fire inspection , sanitary inspection , State , FBI and Child Abuse Checks . Also not included in that price is the required training . Domestic Infant adoptions require 8 hours of training , Domestic Older Child \/ Special needs require 27 hours of training and International is between 8 and 12 hours depending on the country . It takes families about 6 - 8 weeks to complete the paperwork ( although I 've seen some families stretch it out to about 9 months just completing this step ) then there are three interviews required with a social worker . At that point the social worker will write the home study and it will be reviewed by a slew of different people , and then it will be approved , which is when families can enter whatever program they have chosen . The socialworker 's part of the process usually takes about 3 - 4 months so you are looking at an overall time of 4 - 5 months before a family can even start waiting to be matched with a child . As someone else said these processes are put into place as safe guards . No one wants to be responsible to have placed a child into a home where they were hurt , abused or neglected . Agencies and social workers always air on the side of caution and ask for more and more documentation to make sure that everything is crossed . This causes plenty of friction between families and agencies , which is sad to see . Many families see the process as invasive , intrusive and unnecessary , but the social workers are just following regulation . There are also a lot of fees to be paid to USCIS when you are looking at international adoption . Immigration picks up a minimum of $ 1,500 off every family for each child they adopt internationally . Then you 're looking at transaltion fees and country fees to pay to wherever you are adopting to . No one has even touched on the amount of post placements that are required . For a domestic infant adoption the average is about 3 post placements ( another grand ) before you can finalize in the courts . International depends on the country , but there are some countries that require post placements until the child is 18 years old ( even if they were adopted at 18 months old ) . That means you are paying a social worker to come to interview you and write a report ( average of $ 350 per visit \/ report ) for 17 years . The wait varys for each country . The longest that I know of right now is China . A family through our agency just adopted a child from China and they were waiting in the China program for 6 years .

We run on skelton crews to keep the costs as low as possible for families , but there are some circumstances where fees may have to be raised .

You 'll see that that clock \u2014 your reference clock \u2014 says it 's 10:03:38 \u2026 and you 'll set your watch to five after ten . Ish . Give or take . Because that 's * close enough . * Maybe you 'll come back in a week and double - check that your wristwatch is still within a few minutes of your reference clock , but other than that , you wo n't think of it again until your new battery dies . That 's basically how all clock synchronization works . You pick a reference clock , and define * for yourself * a standard of \" close enough , \" then you periodically check to make sure your clock is \" close enough \" to the reference clock . People who * really * care about timekeeping \u2014 like the people responsible for maintaining the global positioning system , for instance \u2014 have built complex automated ways of doing all that to a high degree of precision . But apart from the automation , the basic process works exactly the same way : pick a reference clock , define a \" close enough \" standard , periodically compare your clock to the reference clock , adjust as needed .","The classic ( pre-1950s ) answer is this : 1 . You can tell the local time precisely by observing the sky and doing some math based on the date and your location ( latitude ) . The easiest observation is the position of the sun in the sky . 2 . You can tell the local time at a different location if you know your local time and your location ( longitude ) . So it 's possible for any location that has an observatory and accurate measurements of its own longitude and latitude to determine what the correct solar time is at any other location on Earth . This is the reason why the agencies responsible for telling the standard time are called \" observatories , \" because telling the time precisely used to mean observing the sky carefully . Two example observatories : * [ United States Naval Observatory ] ( URL_2 ) * The United Kingdom 's [ Royal Observatory , Greenwich ] ( URL_0 ) . This one is the historically most important one ; we measure longitude relative to this observatory 's location . Historically , businesses or government agencies that need accurate time got it either directly or indirectly from an observatory . Observatories provide time services that you can use to set a clock . For example , some observatories run special radio stations dedicated to nothing other than broadcasting the time . The USNO runs a [ telephone service ] ( URL_1 ) where you can call an automated voice announcer with accurate time . In the late 19th century and early 20th , railroads were an important means of communicating the standard time . Railroad safety requires accurate clocks , so railroad lines built mechanisms for transmitting the official time to their stations , often with electric systems . So in those days you could set your clock accurately by looking at the train station 's clocks . After the 1950s things get a bit more complicated , because of the invention of atomic clocks . [ juxtap0zed 's answer ] ( URL_3 ) explains those ; what it means is that the standard time is no longer directly tied to the rotation of the Earth , but measured with atomic clocks that are more precise than this rotation . The official atomic clocks are operated by a group of observatories in several countries . And since the 1990s there have been two important new ways of getting accurate time : 1 . GPS satellites are atomic clocks that broadcast their time . A GPS receiver can get extremely accurate time . 2 . Many types of cell phone technology rely on having accurate time as well . So it 's possible to get accurate time by building a machine that listens in to cell phone towers . ( This does n't mean that cell phones automatically get accurate time in their clocks ; for example , I 've seen my iPhone off by as much as 1.5 seconds from the standard time . )","there are official world wide time keepers and they tell people all over the world what time it is . Then those people tell everyone under them what time it is ."],"5366":["There is a concept of marginal utility -- the first dollar is more important than later dollars . If you are homeless , having a dumpy studio is a more beneficial than middle manager being able to upgrade from a 3BR house to a 5BR house . Having food to eat is more important than whether you eat chicken breast or splurge on the steak . And so on ... So the lower earnings dollars are more critical to the basic necessities of life and are thus taxed at a lower rate than dollars earned where they are going to be spent on qualitative enhancements rather than necessities . To keep a tax rate even among all income , then you 'd need to tax people making minimum wage way more then they pay today , when they are already living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to make ends meet -- all while taxing lower taxes from those making six , seven , eight figures or more . Does it sound fair for somebody making $ 15k pay more taxes while cutting the taxes of somebody making $ 1.5 million ? And by the way , tax rates are marginal , too ... this means that everybody pays the same rate on the same dollars earned . If you 're in the top tax bracket , which is 39.6 % you only pay that rate on the dollars you earn over $ 418,400 where that tax rate kicks in -- you DO NOT pay that rate on your entire income . So if you earned $ 50k and somebody else made $ 500k , you 'd both pay the same rate on the first $ 50k earned .","There are two basic justifications for this . First , the idea is that in terms of the impact on someone 's lifestyle of losing a larger percentage of their income matters less as income increases . Second , and related , is that lower - income people are more likely to spend their money , and so taxing it at the same rate reduces economic demand .","Tax brackets are simple way to create a progressive tax . The brackets are a simplification a alternative like a continuous mathematical function to calculate the tax for the income . The motivation of a progressive tax it that a flat tax is a higher budon for people with low income . Everyone need to spend money on the basic things needed to survive like food , housing etc . So a higher tax is is a higher budon for someone that make precisely enough to survive then for a person with twice the income and obvious less a budon for someone with ten time the income . A progressive tag is constructed so every one pays the same tax for the first $ 100 they earn regardless of their total income but the tax rate will be higher for the next $ 100 ( the amounts are just a example ) Som people might argue that a flat tax is more fare the a progressive tag . You could motivate the alternative and the amount the tax increases with income . But to say that we should use flat tax because it is a bit simpler to calculate it not a good way to motivate it . Argue instead for fairness or the ability for a person to pay tax not de difficulty of a simple calculation . To make tax simple you should have tax systems like it is often done in Europe .

However , if the job was something like working on a computer , you could n't deny employment , because there are reasonable accommodations that can be made to allow quadriplegics to use computers .

Longer term , larger scale goals would be to increase membership ( which as I understand it is dwindling dramatically these days ) and also to support one another as any fraternal organization would . There are some places where Masons have purchased whole private neighborhoods , evidently , and give other Masons awesome deals on the houses there or something - I do n't know much about that or other personal financing aspects of membership .

It has nothing to do with the deer ( or other animal ) not being able to see orange . The blaze orange vest and hat are for the walk into the woods and the walk back out . You wear it while walking so that when other hunters hear your movement , they will quickly and clearly realize that you are a person and not something to be shot . Once you are in the woods and have reached the spot from which you will hunt ( tree - stand , blind , or simply a tree you sit against ) , you take off the blaze orange clothing and stow it away out of sight . That way the camouflage blends you into the forest while you sit there motionless observing . EDIT : According to [ projhex ] ( URL_0 ) the color orange was chosen in particular , as opposed to say - yellow , because deer in fact do not have the \" red \" cones in their eyes required to see the color orange . However , while the color does not stand out to the animal , the solid patterns would which is why the vests are generally removed and camouflage is used instead . Learn something new every day ! :)","Most of the people I know wear blaze orange during deer season , because that is when there are the most people in the woods with guns . There are things in the back of your eyes that help you see . They are called rods and cones . Each serves a different purpose . Rods see when it 's darker , but not colors . Cones see the colors in brighter light . People have a lot of cones , so we see color really well . That 's why blaze orange is so bright to us . We do n't have many rods , though , so it is really hard for us to see in the dark . Deer have lots of rods , so they can see real good in the dark . They do n't have many cones , though , so it 's harder for them to see some colors . They see blue colors really good , but it 's hard for them to tell the difference between colors like orange , yellow , and green . That means when you are wearing blaze orange , the deer confuse it with green or yellow , even though people can tell the difference . It 's safer that way , because people know that when they see something bright orange , it 's probably a person , and they should n't kill it .","Hunter Education Instructor here : The key thing when hunting is always safety . That is why many states require you wear blaze orange . Some states ( like mine ) require you wear blaze at all times except when hunting a few specific animals ( Like turkey ) . Other states say that you only have to wear orange while walking to a stand or from a stand . Blaze orange is one of several colors that stands out quickly to the human eye . It is also uncommon in wooded environments . You are n't likely to see something that color , so you can always assume that it is another person . Deer do not really see Blaze Orange . Their vision lies in the Blue - Green spectrum . So blaze orange can be incorporated without causing too much disruption of hunting . When you are hunting other animals ( such as turkey ) you would n't wear blaze orange , as they can pick out the colors easily . And in other cases ( such as fowling ) you would want to wear orange totally as you being hidden is not at all a priority compared with all of the hunters being able to visually spot each other . Now , as for the camouflage patterns , the key purpose of camouflage is to break up the outline of a person . This is achieved by using shapes and colors normally found in the environment , such as leaves , twigs , and branches . Your goal is n't so much to look like a tree as it is to look like nothing . When you are hunting , it is very important not to go with colors such as White , Black , or Tan , as these can lead to you being mistaken for game by a hunter .

Fracking is usually done into a shale formation . These shale formations contain oil and\/or gas in their pores but it is trapped ( high porosity , low permeability ) . When you frac , you pump in a whole bunch of water with chemicals and tiny solids in it at extremely high pressures to form cracks through the shale formation . The chemicals and solids serve to better open and keep the cracks open . This is usually done in the horizontal part of a well drilled into and parallel to the shale formation so that the area of drainage is increased . Good video here : URL_0 Please do n't blanketly say that fracking is always dangerous . It can be done safely or improperly like many things in our industry .","Hydraulic fracturing is a process where an engineered fluid with a variety of chemicals is pumped downhole to induce a fracture in a rock formation . The fluid is injected carrying a proppant sand that is designed to prop open the fractures in the rock . The reason it is so popular is that it has made drilling large horizontal wells in shale layers . Shale is a rock that can hold quite a large volume of hydrocarbons inside but does not allow them to flow through easily . The benefit of fracturing is that it opens up large gas reservoirs that would otherwise not be commercially viable . It has jumped production in the US massively and has opened up a lot of new areas for drilling . The drawback is that some studies have shown that areas that have been hydraulically fractured have seemed to indicate that natural gas had entered the drinking water supply . So far there has not been any evidence of chemicals from the fracturing fluid entering fresh water reserves * * EDIT**:The article independent has linked to below cites a failure on the part of the wastewater treatment plant to adequately treat water used in the fracturing process . This is a major concern , and one of the reasons I conclude by stating that additional effects do need to be studied . Regulations do need to be more strongly enforced . Another major drawback is the large amount of water required to perform a frack job . This water is obviously no longer drinkable . I am on my phone at present and therefore can not provide websites for further reading but I am a petroleum engineer and this is obviously a massive debate in the industry right now . Is it safe ? I ca n't say . I think both sides are unwilling to compromise and I think there is room to do so . I do n't believe it 's 2012 end of the world , but the effects definitely need to be studied more for how prominent fracturing has become .","johnnybg00de did great job of explaining the process of Hydraulic Fracking , just want to help on the second part of your question a little . With a few things to keep in mind when reading the research on Fracking so far . Natural gas , is well , natural . As in , it already occurs in the ground , and at many different depths , both shallow and deep . Methane is one of the most abundant compounds on Earth . It has already been a problem , per se , when digging water wells , and ore mines for thousands of years . Methane is colorless and odorless ( the smell is added so people can detect leaks ) , and is considered non toxic and biologically inert . Methane is only detected if tested for . Many water wells are already abandoned because of contaminants ( not just methane ) , either they were not built correctly or where damaged and not repaired . Water wells are a little more complicated than simply digging a hole . Now of course , Hydraulic Frackings purpose is to extract natural gas from the ground . It 's an expensive and committed project , and you do n't just drill anywhere . You locate where there is a lot of natural gas , and drill there . Now still being completely unbiased , there does appear to be quite a number of reports , linking methane in drinking water ( well water ) , with areas where Fracking is going on . However , so far these appear to be cases of correlation , not causation . Simply , where there is a lot of natural gas , there will be wells with gas in them , and Fracking sites wanting to extract the gas . So far , there has been no cases of Fracking chemicals in peoples drinking water , meaning the gas has most likely come from another source . I am unaware of any reports measuring methane levels in drinking water both before and after Fracking happens . Which is understandable ; why test for methane if you have n't thought to before .

They 've been on cease - fire since 1997 , they supported the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 , and they disarmed in 2005 . They are perceived negatively because they undertook a campaign of terrorist violence , and killed many civilians in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK . By no means were they the only bad people in The Troubles , and their motivations and the circumstances that led to their existence are pretty complicated . Jeremy Corbyn 's relationship to the IRA comes from him being closely related to Sinn Fein , a political party in Ireland and Northern Ireland who are the biggest pro - Republic party in Northern Ireland . Sinn Fein and the IRA have always been linked , although Sinn Fein denies any formal ties . Sinn Fein is the legitimate face of Irish Republicanism , the IRA was the militant face .","# HISTORY Hello my friend . The IRA is the Irish Republican Army and takes many forms throughout history . A quick view of the history . In 1171 the Pope made the King of England the Lord of Ireland ( ELI5 the leader of Ireland ) . With this the Kingdom of England took over Ireland . The Irish did n't like this and they rebelled . This got a lot worse when the religious divide came . After the Act of Union with Ireland 1800 the Irish were represented in Westminster . In 1885 the Home Rule Party was formed , they wanted a federal British Empire with an Imperial Parlaiment in Westminster and a Parliament in Dublin . This is similar to federal states like USA . The HRP was relplaced by other parties who became more pro inderpendance . In 1916 the Irish had there first rising in a long time and the Provisional Republic of Ireland stood a proud nation among the nations of the world for 3 days . # TYPES OF IRA In 1918 another rising came , this one was much more succesful . This was the first IRA , or the Old IRA . They were fighting for an independant Ireland . They made peace with the British and the Irish Free State was formed , this free state was owned by the British Crown . The treaty led to a split in the IRA and the anti treaty members remained IRA and the pro treaty members became the National Army of Ireland . The Irish and British put down the IRA . After the 1920s the action died down with moderate acts of terror both in the Irish Free State ( Southern Ireland ) and Northern Ireland . In the 1960s action kicked up again over problems of civil rights in Northern Ireland for the Catholics , a lot of the concerns were valid . A split developed in the IRA following the failed Border Campaign , that eneded in 1962 . The IRA split into two groups ; Provisional IRA ( PIRA or Provos ) , left wing socialsits and the more popular of the IRAs , when people refer to the IRA they often mean the PIRA . Official IRA ( OIRA ) , marxist and even further to the left to PIRA . In the 1980s the PIRA had another split ; PIRA Continuity Irish Republican Army ( CIRA ) this was over disagrements to not taking seats in the Republic of Ireland . PIRA made peace with the British in 1997 and this peace led to the Real IRA ( rIRA ) people who ca n't accpet the peace . Finally in 2012 a New IRA ( NIRA ) formed from all the splinter groups of the IRAs ( which is n't a lot of people ) . # WHY THE PIRA ARE UNLIKED The PIRA are unliked because they brought violence when people wanted peace , even in Northern Ireland they only had 13 % support ( Sinn Fein vote share in NI in the troubles ) . There was no need for the violence yet they brought it anyway . The PIRA had gang like control of Northern Ireland and were more like the Mafia than a liberation army . My Great Grandfather was made a refugue as he refused to pay the PIRA protection money . He was a Catholic Irish man from County Sligo who moved to County Derry . The PIRA were thugs . They targeted civilians and governemnt figures . # CORBYN AND THE PIRA Corbyn had a close relationship with the IRA , so close MI5 and MI6 ( British domestic and foreign secret service ) opened a case agaisnt him an spied on him , an elected member of Westminster under MI5 and MI6 investigation . After the Brighton Hotel Bombing , an attack that killed four tories including one MP and was the attempt by the IRA to kill the entire government of the UK , thankfully they failed . A few short weeks later Corbyn invited form prisoners who were PIRA into Parlaiment ! Corbyn worked to legitimise the violent terorist members of the Catholic Community , not the SDLP who wanted a peaceful solution . Corbyn voted agaisnt peace ( Anglo - Irish treaty 1985 ) he wanted an Irish revolutuion to conqure all Ireland .","Irish Republican Army .

These rights was first affirmed in 1819 in the Supreme Court case , Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward , and has been consistently upheld throughout US history . 3 . Freedom of speech means that individuals have the right to speak their mind . They have the right to express themselves in a newspaper . They have the right to start a newspaper and express their opinion in it . They have the right to pay other newspapers to print their opinions . They have the right to express support for political leaders . They have the right to express disdain for political leaders . They have the right to make a film critical of political leaders , and to pay TV stations to air them . 4 . If you recognize that groups of individuals have the same rights as each of the individuals , and that individuals have the right to freedom of speech , you basically have Citizen 's United .

The groups can be corporations , loose associations , labor unions , non - profits , for - profits , whatever . It applies to any group of people . The downside is that there are a lot of practical problems that come along with this interpretation of the Constitution .

If we compromise on freedom of speech and our other civil rights when it 's inconvenient , what is the point of even having them ?","> the same legal rights as a person ? Not all , just some .

All sorts of industries rely on the concept of the \" summer vacation , \" and for a lot of them it makes economic sense to capitalize off of huge amounts of visitors concentrated in a three - month period . * Could * we change it ?

I 'll say a few words about the biology of human physical attraction . It turns out that , in my opinion , human attraction is deeply evolutionary . As a quick disclaimer , I 'm talking about heterosexual men and women here . So there are some traits that are pretty much universally found attractive . People * * typically * * find symmetry attractive in faces , and men in general typically prefer more feminized faces . However , women tend to find all sorts of male faces attractive , both more masculine and more feminine male faces . However , there 's this trend where women from countries who score lower on the National Health Index find more masculine male faces more attractive . This makes sense , since in these countries , health and robustness in men are probably some of the most important factors towards reproducing and passing on genes , and a highly masculinized male face is probably associated with higher testosterone , and thus more strength and aggression . Also , in the United States and many Western countries , the \" most \" attractive women typically are of a healthy weight with a high hip to waist ratio . However , when a remote Peruvian civilization called the Matsingenka with no contact to Western civilization was surveyed , they found more overweight women to be the \" most attractive \" . This is because the Matsingenka are constantly on the edge of survival , so if a woman is overweight , it is likely she 's good at getting food , which is vital for survival . Finally , women with higher estrogen levels have been shown to be more attracted to men with more masculinized faces . This is probably because women with higher estrogen levels are more fertile , and so they should mate with men who are as fertile as possible as well in order to produce offspring . Men with more masculinized faces have higher testosterone , and thus are more fertile .","Our tastes in attractiveness are based partly on who we saw around us growing up . Certain things seem normal , certain things seem weird .","Life is a mix of nature and nurture .

When alcohol enters your body it get metabolized to form a ketone or an aldehyde . What metabolite is produced is dependent on what alcohol is being metabolized . Regular drinking alcohol ( ethyl alcohol ) gets metabolized into acetaldehyde which is n't very toxic to humans but is part of the reason you feel hungover . When rubbing alcohol ( isopropyl alcohol ) is metabolized it forms a ketone called acetone , also known as nail polish remover . Acetone acts as a central nervous system depressent and will lead to headaches then dizziness then vomiting then a coma if taken in large enough quantities . So it 's really not the rubbing alcohol that hurts you its what your body does with it . If someone drinks rubbing alcohol or antifreeze which contains methyl alcohol ( metabolizes into formaldehyde ) of course the best thing to do is get them to the hospital . If that 's not an option for some reason , getting them drunk and keeping them drunk for a while will also save them . This is because ethyl alcohol has a higher affinity for the enzyme that metabolizes all alcohols so your body will be too busy metabolizing the ethyl alcohol to metabolize the other alcohol . Eventually the isopropyl or methyl alcohol will be excreted in the urine and no harm will be done .","\" Alcohol \" refers to a class of compounds that contain a hydroxyl group . _ Drinking alcohol _ is [ ethanol ] ( URL_1 ) , and your body is pretty good at eliminating it .

Out of the non - ethyl alcohols available , isopropyl is really not * that * bad . Everything I 've seen tends to suggest that drinking it is n't likely to kill you . Reports suggest that it is far more potent at getting you drunk ( including dangerously so ) , such that a shot or two would have even the sturdiest drinkers kneeling at the porcelain throne ; more than that and you 're looking at severe alcohol poisoning as if you had had drank to far excess . This is n't to say that all alcohols are just different strengths of the same juice , though . For example , Methanol , or \" wood alcohol \" can be toxic in a dosage as little as 10 mL -- that 's less than a single shot . This is because inside of your body it gets broken down into formic acid -- this is the substance that ants inject when they bite you . When you drink methanol the formic acid breaks down the optic nerve and goes after other body systems , so you go blind and die unless treated ( ironically , one of the standard treatments is to liquor you up -- if you can get enough ethanol in your system then your body will process that instead of the methanol and you 'll be more or less fine , save the hangover and whatever lasting damage the formic acid does ) ."],"4428":["To create artificial scarcity so when they bring it back , there 's a frenzy for them .

Basically , it builds on absurdism . Absurdism is the idea that the world is meaningless but you have to accept it and keep living anyway . Existentialism says that existence is inherently meaningless ; your actions and decisions shape your own values and thus yourself . You give your own life meaning . In an eli5 analogy , you 're born without any innate values . You do n't know what flavor of ice cream you like or what things you like to do . You have n't developed any values yet . You 're like a blank canvas . The world around you and rest of your life experiences will add and shape your canvas . To do this , you have to actively do stuff in life . Some people just sit around and copy other people 's canvases . I hate Justin Bieber because everyone else does ! I love Carl Sagan because Reddit does !

Those experiences will help me develop my own meaning and my own essence .","Defining Existentialism as movement or school of thought is somewhat problematic from the very outset . Most philosophers casually known to be Existentialists in fact either rejected the label , or were co - opted into the movement posthumously . Upon analyzing their works we can see why many would reject being lumped together : their differences almost outweigh their similarities . Kierkegaard , the purposed \" father \" of existentialism , was arguing for faith in God , Nietzsche is an anti - theist if there ever was one , Heidegger was a Nazi , and Sartre was a Marxist . What seems to be crucial in all their philosophies , however , is the emphasis on human subjectivity , real human existence on a fundamental level , and a disdain for the lofty , overarching metaphysical abstractions that philosophy is known for . The existential movement hangs on Sartre . He is responsible for popularizing it and is , along with De \u2018 Beauvoir , one of the few who took the label upon himself . All the other existentialists are recognized as so through their relation to him . The sort of existentialism that Sartre advocates can be summarized in the famous maxim \" existence precedes essence \" . What this means is best understood against Plato . In Platonism everything that exists does so by partaking in the nature of some universal archetype . So a particular rock is only a rock because it is a particular manifestation of the universal nature of rocks . Plato believes that these universal natures are in fact real things , and that they exist eternally , and unchanging . The existence of these archetypes is not dependent upon the existence of any particular thing ; rather , the existence of particular things depends upon these archetypes . This notion applies to humans as well . We all come into existence with a predefined nature which is guaranteed by the universal human archetype which existed eternally before any of us did . Another way we can understand this is through the notion of the \" soul \" which provides each and every one of us with a particular fixed nature , made by God , before we came into existence . Under this view essence , our \" human nature \" , will precede our existence , just like a house made from a blueprint , or an object made in a factory . As an atheist , Sartre believes that all of this is rubbish . Without any God , or any universal archetypes to guarantee our nature before we are born , we get to determine for ourselves just what we will be ; first we come into existence , then we get to determine what exactly we will be . Our nature is to be our own fashioning . Now this may sound very nice to some , in a superficial \" choose your own destiny \" kind of way , but if we take this view seriously we find that it leaves us with no way of appealing to any objective standards to legitimize our existence . We are faced with the unbearable contingency of our being , with no solid ground beneath us . Say I am in a long distance , monogamous relationship and as such can not have sex with my partner . But I really want sex so I go out and start cheating on her with other women . Eventually she finds out and calls me out on it . As an Existentialist , I can not attempt to justify myself by claiming that as a man I have needs and ca n't be blamed for following my biological urges . Existentialists do n't get to have that luxury . In doing so I would be acting in a way that would be considered * inauthentic * . In existentialism * authenticity * simply means that I recognize the contingency of my existence . My nature is not fixed , but instead is a possibility , and is always \" up in the air \" with nothing at all beneath it . Authenticity is a very rare thing for anyone to achieve as we generally navigate the world , deploying ourselves according to a certain mental picture of who exactly we are and what a person like us does . A homosexual man , for example , may take upon himself a rather flamboyant , feminine personality . Why ? Not because there is anything about homosexuality that determines these behaviors , but because this is the sort of identity that he constructs for himself based upon his sexuality and then takes this identity to necessarily be himself . When we act in an inauthentic manner , we allow ourselves to feel as if we are indispensable , that we could not be different if we tried . While this is extremely comforting , it does not properly characterize what we are because it reduces us to a mere object instead of recognizing our freedom to choose as human beings . What this amounts to is an immense burden of responsibility for the individual . You are responsible for who you are , there is no objective standard out there which you can appeal to justify yourself . There is no greater meaning independent of what you yourself determine there to be . Your whole life can be spent struggling to achieve something of worth , but in objective terms it amounts to nothing . Only subjectively does your existence matter , it is all up to you . tl;dr : Existentialism is hard to summarize .","It 's about coming to grips with the question , \" Why am I experiencing things ? \" .

In this case , the supply is the amount of available drivers in a given area , and the demand is the amount of people who need rides in the same area .

Sometimes , there are more passengers looking for rides at the standard price than there are drivers willing to pick up passengers for that standard price . That means there are long delays and people are n't necessarily able to get where they want to go for the price they 're willing to pay . To combat that , Uber creates surge pricing . The surge pricing does two things : First , it encourages more drivers to come out and drive ; more people are willing to accept rides if they get paid more to do it . Second , it makes fewer passengers look for rides ; more people will find other alternatives to Uber if the prices are higher . By increasing supply and decreasing demand , surge prices make it so that there are enough drivers willing to meet the demands of all of the passengers who are willing to pay the price it takes to get a ride .","Say there \u2019s a concert going on in a particular area , or it \u2019s simply a popular nightlife destination .

It is often carried out on girls between infancy and the age of 15, and is done for a variety of reasons, including cultural, religious, and social beliefs. In Egypt, female circumcision is a longstanding tradition that is often considered a rite of passage. Some people believe that it is necessary for a girl's cleanliness, modesty, and future marriage prospects. Others may see it as a way to reduce a woman's libido and prevent premarital sex. However, there is no scientific or medical justification for female circumcision, and it has been condemned by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international organizations as a human rights violation. The vast majority of women in Egypt who have undergone female circumcision have had it done to them against their will. They may have been subjected to the practice because of pressure from their families or community, or because they were not given a choice in the matter. Many women may not fully understand the implications of the procedure, or may be unaware of the risks and complications that can result. Female circumcision is a painful and traumatic experience that can have serious physical and psychological consequences for the women who undergo it. It can cause severe bleeding, infection, scarring, and even death. It can also lead to difficulties with urination, sexual dysfunction, and childbirth.

Another reason is that older people often have less to do during the day, which can make them feel tired and in need of more sleep. This can be especially true if they are retired or not as active as they used to be. Finally, it's important to remember that everyone's sleep needs are different, and it's normal for people of all ages to have different sleep patterns.

It is a number that tells us how many atoms or molecules are in a certain amount of a substance.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a substance called \"sugar.\" If we have one mole of sugar, that means we have 6.022 x 10^23 molecules of sugar. This number is known as Avogadro's number, and it is the same for any substance.\n\nSo, if we want to convert between mass, mole, and molecule, we can use Avogadro's number to help us.\n\nFor example, let's say we have 10 grams of sugar. We can use Avogadro's number to convert this to moles by dividing the mass by the molecular weight of the sugar. The molecular weight of sugar is 342.3 g\/mol, so 10 grams of sugar is equal to 0.0292 moles of sugar.\n\nWe can also use Avogadro's number to convert from moles to molecules.

Some people in Scotland want their country to be independent, which means they would not be part of the UK anymore and would have their own government that makes decisions for Scotland. The main reason some people in Scotland want independence is because they feel like they have different interests and values than the rest of the UK, and they want to be able to make their own decisions about how to run their country. Some people in Scotland also feel like they have not always been treated equally by the UK government, and they believe that an independent Scotland would be better able to address these issues.

It is a complex and multifaceted concept, but at its core, it is a reaction against the modernist movement that preceded it.\r\n\r\nModernism, which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, was characterized by a belief in progress, reason, and the power of human beings to shape their own destiny through science and technology. Modernists believed that there was a single, objective truth that could be discovered through reason and evidence.\r\n\r\nPostmodernism, on the other hand, challenges these ideas. It suggests that there is no single, objective truth, and that all knowledge is shaped by the cultural, social, and historical context in which it is produced. Instead of seeing the world as a collection of objective facts that can be studied and understood, postmodernists view it as a series of subjective interpretations and perspectives.\r\n\r\nPostmodernism also emphasizes the idea that power is not evenly distributed in society, and that the dominant narrative or ideology is often used to oppress and control marginalized groups. It encourages people to be more critical of the stories and narratives that are presented to them, and to question the assumptions and biases that may be underlying them.\r\n\r\nSo, to explain postmodernism to a five-year-old, you could say that it's a way of thinking that helps us understand that there are many different ways to see the world, and that we should be open to hearing and considering all of them, rather than just believing one \"right\" way."],"9822":["When someone \"masters\" an album, it means that they have taken the final mix of the album and made some final adjustments to it to prepare it for release.

While it can be useful in some cases, it is not always accurate and can produce translations that are difficult to understand or contain errors.One reason that Google Translate can be inaccurate is that it relies on patterns and statistical relationships in large amounts of translated text to try and generate translations. This means that it may not always be able to properly translate more complex or nuanced language, or words and phrases that are not commonly used.Another issue with Google Translate is that it cannot always properly convey the context or tone of the original text. This can lead to translations that are funny, confusing, or even offensive.In general, Google Translate is best used as a quick and rough translation tool, rather than a reliable and accurate translation service. It can be helpful for getting a general idea of what a piece of text means, but it should not be relied upon for important or official translations.Google Translate works best for short, simple phrases and sentences, and for languages that are closely related to each other. It may also be more accurate for translations between languages that have a lot of translated text available for the algorithm to learn from. However, even in these cases, it is still important to double-check the translation to make sure it is accurate."],"14496":["There are a few reasons why it can be difficult for Google Fiber or any other internet service provider (ISP) to expand into new cities: 1. Infrastructure: Building a new fiber optic network requires laying a lot of cables and building new infrastructure, which can be costly and time-consuming. 2. Competition: There may be other ISPs that already have a strong presence in the city, which can make it difficult for a new provider like Google Fiber to enter the market. 3. Regulations: There may be local regulations or policies that make it difficult for Google Fiber or other ISPs to build their networks in certain areas. 4. Demand: In order for an ISP like Google Fiber to justify the cost of building a new network in a city, there needs to be enough demand for their service. If not enough people are interested in signing up for Google Fiber, it may not be financially viable for the company to expand into that city. Overall, it can be challenging for any ISP to enter a new market, but it's not impossible. Google Fiber has successfully expanded into a number of cities around the United States, and it is always looking for opportunities to bring its high-speed internet service to more areas."],"9545":["Photogenic means that someone looks good in pictures. Some people just naturally look good in pictures because of the way their face is structured. For example, they might have nice, symmetrical features or great bone structure. This can make them look more attractive in pictures.\r\n\r\nOther people might not be as naturally photogenic, but they can still look good in pictures by paying attention to things like lighting and posing. For example, if they make sure to stand in a spot with good lighting, and position themselves in a way that is flattering to their features, they can still look good in pictures.\r\n\r\nSo, some people are just naturally photogenic, while others might have to work a little harder to look good in pictures.

It's kind of like a recipe that tells our bodies how to grow and develop.\\n\\nWhen our cells divide, they make copies of our DNA so that the new cells have the same instructions. Then, the cells use the instructions in the DNA to make proteins, which are like tiny machines that do different jobs in our bodies.\\n\\nSome proteins help build things like bones and muscles, while others help with chemical reactions or sending signals between cells.\\n\\nThe proteins that are made from the instructions in our DNA can be really complex, and they help to build and shape our bodies in all sorts of ways. For example, proteins can help build blood vessels and neurons, which are both really important for how our bodies work.\\n\\nBlood vessels carry blood throughout our bodies, and neurons are cells in our brains and nerves that help us think and feel and move. Both of these things are really complex and important, and they depend on the instructions in our DNA to grow and work properly.\\n\\nI hope that helps!

Each of these parts is called a degree, and they are used to measure angles. \nOne reason that 360 degrees was chosen as the number of parts to divide a circle into is that it is a highly composite number, which means that it can be evenly divided by many smaller numbers. For example, 360 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, and 360. This makes it easier to do calculations involving angles, because the degree measurements can be divided and multiplied by these smaller numbers. \nAnother reason for using 360 degrees to measure angles is that it allows for a lot of precision. Dividing a circle into 100 parts, for example, would not allow for as much precision in measuring angles as dividing it into 360 parts would. Similarly, dividing a circle into 400 or 1000 parts would not be as useful, because these numbers are not as easily divisible by smaller numbers. \nOverall, the choice to use 360 degrees to measure angles is a practical one that has stood the test of time. It allows for a good balance of precision and ease of calculation."],"3302":["Babies might laugh when someone gets hurt because they haven't yet learned about things like empathy, which is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. They might not understand that getting hurt is not a funny or enjoyable experience for the person who was hurt. It's also possible that the baby is laughing in response to the facial expressions and body language of the person who got hurt. When we're in pain, we might make faces or movements that look comical or exaggerated to a baby. Babies are very attuned to facial expressions and body language, and they might find these cues amusing. It's important to remember that babies are still learning about the world and how to interact with others. As they grow and develop, they will learn more about empathy and the appropriate ways to react to different situations."],"7304":["The center of a galaxy is super bright because it is usually home to a supermassive black hole. A black hole is an object that is so dense and has such strong gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This means that a black hole is invisible, because it does not allow any light to escape and be seen.However, the black hole at the center of a galaxy is often surrounded by a lot of gas, dust, and other material. When this material falls into the black hole, it gets very hot and produces a lot of light. This light is what makes the center of a galaxy super bright.So, even though a black hole is invisible, it can still produce a lot of light by heating up the material around it. This is why the center of a galaxy can be super bright even though it is home to a supermassive black hole."],"8772":["There are a few reasons why there may not be as many female taxi drivers in your area.

One reason is that the movie studio wants to make sure that as many people as possible see the movie in theaters first, because this is typically where they make the most money.\n\nAnother reason is that it takes time to convert the movie into the format that is used for DVDs and Blu-ray discs. This process is called \"mastering,\" and it involves transferring the movie from the original film or digital format to a format that can be used for home video. This process can be time-consuming, especially if the movie is long or has a lot of special effects.\n\nWho does this process depends on the movie studio. Some studios have their own in-house teams that handle the mastering process, while others outsource it to third-party companies. Either way, the goal is to make sure that the movie looks and sounds as good as possible on a home video format.\n\nI hope this helps!

At its core, the conflict is about competing claims to land and sovereignty in the region known as Palestine, which includes the modern state of Israel and the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The conflict has its roots in the late 1800s, when Jewish immigrants began moving to Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire. These immigrants, known as Zionists, believed that Palestine was the ancient homeland of the Jewish people and that they had a right to live there. However, the region was already home to a large Arab population, which opposed the influx of Jewish immigrants and the establishment of a Jewish state. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire following World War I, the League of Nations granted a mandate to Britain to administer Palestine. The British government encouraged Jewish immigration to Palestine, but also promised to protect the rights of the Arab population. In 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem being designated as an international city. The Jewish community accepted the plan, but the Arab states rejected it and launched a war against the newly established state of Israel. Since then, the conflict has continued, with numerous wars, negotiations, and peace agreements attempted to resolve the dispute. The main issues at stake are control of Jerusalem, the status of Palestinian refugees, the building of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, and the right of Palestinian self-determination. The conflict has also been fueled by religious and cultural differences, as well as political and economic interests. It has caused significant suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians, and has had a major impact on the region and the world."],"16459":["The 1\/4 mile and 0 to 60 mph benchmarks are commonly used to rate cars because they are easy to measure and compare, and they give a good indication of a car's performance. The 1\/4 mile distance is about the length of a drag strip, which is a special type of track that is designed specifically for racing cars. It's a good distance to use because it's long enough to show how fast a car can accelerate, but not so long that it takes too long to complete.\n\nThe 0 to 60 mph benchmark is also a good way to measure a car's acceleration, because it's a widely recognized standard. It measures how quickly a car can go from a standing start to 60 mph, which is a common speed on highways.\n\nIt's possible to test cars on other distances or speeds, but the 1\/4 mile and 0 to 60 mph benchmarks are widely accepted and understood, so they are often used as a way to compare the performance of different cars."],"5798":["Melting ice doesn't actually change the taste of water. Water itself has no taste, since it is a pure substance and contains no compounds that are capable of being tasted. However, the taste of water can be affected by various factors, such as the minerals and impurities that are present in it, the types of containers that it is stored in, and the substances that it comes into contact with.\\n\\nFor example, if ice has been made from tap water that contains a lot of minerals or impurities, then the water that is left behind after the ice has melted may taste differently than pure, distilled water. This is because the minerals and impurities that were present in the tap water will still be present in the water after the ice has melted. Similarly, if the ice was made in a container that had an unusual taste or smell, such as a plastic container that has absorbed odors from other substances, then the water may taste differently as well.\\n\\nSo, if you notice that water tastes different after the ice has melted, it might be because of one of these factors rather than the ice itself."],"11488":["I'm sorry, but I cannot view external links or browse the web, so I cannot see the test you are referring to.

Derivatives are a way to measure how much a function is changing at a certain point. They can be thought of as a slope of a function, similar to how a slope of a hill tells you how steep the hill is. To find the derivative of a function, we use a special notation called \"d\/dx,\" which stands for \"the change in y (the output of the function) divided by the change in x (the input to the function).\" For example, if we have the function y = x^2, we can find the derivative by using the notation like this: dy\/dx = 2x, This tells us that, for every small change in x, the output of the function (y) will change by 2 times the size of that change in x. Derivatives have many important applications. For example, they can be used to optimize things (such as finding the maximum profit for a company), to understand how systems change over time (such as population growth or the spreading of a disease), and to model physical phenomena (such as the motion of a falling object).

However, it is true that some Asian countries do have lower rates of obesity compared to other parts of the world.\n\nOne factor that may contribute to this is diet. Many Asian countries have traditional diets that are rich in plant-based foods such as rice, vegetables, and beans, which are generally lower in calories and fat compared to some Western diets that may be higher in processed and fried foods. In addition, many Asian cultures have a tradition of eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day rather than large, infrequent meals, which can help to regulate appetite and prevent overeating.\n\nAnother factor that may play a role is physical activity. Many Asian cultures place a strong emphasis on staying active and physically fit, which can help to maintain a healthy weight.\n\nIt's also important to note that genetics can play a role in body weight and size.

Yeast, which is a type of fungus, is able to tolerate high levels of alcohol because it has evolved ways to protect itself from the toxic effects of alcohol. When yeast ferments sugars to produce alcohol, it generates a chemical called ethanol. Ethanol is toxic to many types of bacteria, which is why it is often used as a natural preservative in foods and beverages. However, yeast is able to survive and continue growing in the presence of ethanol because it has special enzymes that break down the ethanol and convert it into energy. So, even though alcohol is produced by yeast, the yeast are able to tolerate the alcohol and continue living. But other types of bacteria may not be able to withstand the toxic effects of alcohol and will die when exposed to it."],"2509":["Operation Desert Storm was a military campaign that took place in the early 1990s. It was led by the United States, with the help of other countries, to force Iraq to leave Kuwait, a small country in the Middle East. Before the operation, Iraq, a country led by a leader named Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait and took over the country. The United States and other countries did not like this, so they decided to help Kuwait and stop Iraq from taking over. To do this, the United States and its allies (countries that were helping) sent in soldiers and airplanes to fight against Iraq. The fighting happened in the desert, which is why it was called \"Desert Storm.\" The United States and its allies were able to defeat Iraq and force them to leave Kuwait. This was a big victory for the United States and its allies, and it helped to keep peace in the Middle East. I hope this helps to explain the basics of Operation Desert Storm. Let me know if you have any other questions."],"16693":["Self-harm is a serious and often misunderstood behavior. It is not something that people do for attention or because they want to hurt themselves. Instead, people who self-harm may do so as a way to cope with overwhelming emotions, such as depression, anxiety, or trauma. They may also self-harm as a way to feel more in control of their body or their environment.\n\nSelf-harm can take many forms, such as cutting, burning, or hitting oneself. It is important to remember that self-harm is not a healthy way to cope with difficult feelings and it is important to seek help if you or someone you know is self-harming. A mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, can help you find healthier ways to cope with your emotions and work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to your self-harm."],"15489":["The hot pocket sleeve is a small, disposable container that is designed to hold a hot pocket while it is being cooked. It is made of paper or cardboard and is coated with a layer of wax or other material to help it withstand the heat of the oven.\n\nThe purpose of the hot pocket sleeve is to keep the hot pocket from getting too hot and burning, and to help it cook evenly. It also helps to keep the hot pocket moist and prevent it from drying out.\n\nThe hot pocket sleeve works by trapping heat inside it, which helps to cook the hot pocket more evenly. It also helps to keep the hot pocket from coming into direct contact with the heating element or surface of the oven, which can cause it to burn.\n\nSo, in short, the hot pocket sleeve is used to help cook the hot pocket more evenly and to prevent it from getting too hot or burning."],"15243":["Decibels (dB) are a unit used to measure the intensity or loudness of a sound. The decibel scale is based on a logarithmic relationship, which means that each increase of 10 dB represents a tenfold increase in the intensity of the sound.\n\nA sound that is 10 times more intense than another sound is said to be 10 dB louder. For example, a sound that is 100 times more intense than another sound is 20 dB louder, because 10 x 10 = 100, and 20 is the next number on the decibel scale.\n\nNegative decibels are used to describe sound intensity levels that are lower than the reference level, which is defined as 0 dB. For example, if the reference level is the sound of a whisper, a sound that is half as loud as a whisper would be -6 dB.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify things!

It is meant to be a humorous and lighthearted way for people to talk about the difficulties that they encounter in their daily lives. The word \"fifthworld\" is a play on the word \"firstworld,\" which is often used to describe the problems or challenges that people in developed countries face. For example, \"first world problems\" might include things like having too many choices at a grocery store or struggling to get a good cell phone signal. So, the \"fifthworldproblems\" subreddit is a way for people to share and joke about the problems and challenges that they face, no matter where they live or what their circumstances might be.

One reason is that it can be expensive to install solar panels on a home or building. Another reason is that some areas do not get a lot of sunlight, so solar panels may not work as well in those places. Finally, some people may not know about solar technology or may not understand how it works. Despite these challenges, many people are still interested in using solar energy because it is a clean and renewable source of energy."],"6347":["Sure! Overbooking flights is a common practice in the airline industry. It's when an airline sells more tickets for a particular flight than there are seats on the plane. The reason they do this is because they know that not everyone who buys a ticket will actually show up to fly. Sometimes people miss their flights, cancel their trips, or change their plans.By overbooking flights, airlines can make sure that they fill up as many seats as possible and maximize their profits. However, there is always a risk that more people will show up to fly than there are seats on the plane. In this case, the airline may have to ask some passengers to take a later flight or offer compensation, such as a voucher or other type of reimbursement, in order to get people to give up their seats.Overall, overbooking flights can be a helpful way for airlines to fill up their planes and make money, but it can also lead to problems if too many people show up to fly and there aren't enough seats."],"8975":["It is not appropriate for me to comment on specific cases or companies. However, in general, it is possible for a company to use the work of independent artists without permission or compensation.

It is a high-pitched noise that some computers make when they are working hard. It is caused by the electrical current passing through tiny coils of wire inside the computer. These coils of wire are called \"inductors\" and they help to regulate the flow of electricity in the computer. When the electrical current passes through the inductors, it can cause the wires to vibrate and make a noise. Some computers are more prone to coil whine than others, and it is usually more noticeable when the computer is under heavy load, like when it is running demanding tasks or playing games."],"2270":["I'm sorry to hear that you've been without power for so long. There could be a number of reasons why it takes time for power companies to restore power, but some common reasons include: The cause of the power outage needs to be identified and fixed: In order to restore power, the power company needs to find out what caused the outage. This could be something like a tree falling on a power line or a piece of equipment malfunctioning. Once the cause is found, the power company can start working on fixing it. Repairs can be complicated: Depending on the cause of the outage, it might take some time to fix the problem. For example, if a tree has fallen on a power line, the power company might need to remove the tree before they can repair the line. If the problem is with a piece of equipment, the power company might need to bring in specialized equipment or technicians to fix it. Safety is a top priority: Power company workers need to be very careful when working on repairing power lines and other equipment. They have to follow safety protocols to make sure they don't get hurt, and this can take time. There might be a lot of damage: If there has been a natural disaster like a storm or a hurricane, there might be a lot of damage to the power system. It could take a long time to fix all of the different problems that have occurred. I hope this helps to explain why it might take some time to restore power. It's important to be patient and to follow the instructions of the power company while they work to fix the problem."],"9611":["In 1913, the United States implemented an income tax as a way to raise money for the government to fund various programs and services. At the time, the government relied mainly on tariffs (taxes on imported goods) and excises (taxes on specific products or activities) to generate revenue. However, these sources of funding were not sufficient to meet the needs of the growing country, so the government looked for other ways to raise money.\r\n\r\nThe idea of an income tax was not new, as other countries had already implemented similar systems. However, it had previously been rejected in the United States because many people felt that it was unfair or intrusive.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, the government passed the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, which allowed for the implementation of a federal income tax. This amendment was ratified (approved) by the states and became part of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe income tax was seen as a way to fund the government and provide for the common good, such as building roads and schools and providing for the defense of the country. It was also seen as a way to make the tax system more fair, as it taxed people based on their ability to pay (their income).\r\n\r\nOverall, the American people accepted the income tax because they believed it was necessary for the government to function and serve the needs of the country."],"6618":["In the United Kingdom, it is generally not the norm for police officers to carry firearms. This is because the UK has a lower rate of gun ownership and gun crime compared to some other countries, such as Canada and the United States. As a result, the police in the UK generally do not feel the need to carry guns as a routine part of their duties. Instead, they rely on other methods of law enforcement, such as using pepper spray, batons, and tasers.However, it is important to note that not all police officers in the UK are unarmed. There are specially trained units, such as the Firearms Support Units, that are equipped with guns and can be called upon if needed in certain situations, such as a terrorist attack or a hostage situation.In general, the decision to arm or not arm the police is a complex one that depends on a variety of factors, including the level of crime and violence in a particular area, the cultural and historical context, and the resources available to the police force."],"16602":["Daylight Saving Time (DST) is a way of adjusting the time on the clock so that there is more daylight in the evenings during certain parts of the year. It was first used in the United States during World War I as a way to save energy by reducing the need for artificial lighting.\n\nOne of the main arguments for using DST is that it can help people make better use of the daylight hours. For example, if it gets dark at 5 p.m. during the winter months, it can be difficult for people to do outdoor activities or to enjoy the sunshine after work. By setting the clocks ahead by one hour in the spring, people can stay outside for an extra hour and enjoy the sunlight.\n\nHowever, DST also has some drawbacks. It can be confusing for people to have to change their clocks twice a year, and some studies have shown that it can affect people's sleep patterns and cause other problems.\n\nArizona and a few other states in the U.S. do not observe DST because they feel that the benefits of changing the clocks do not outweigh the drawbacks. However, most states and countries around the world do still observe DST."],"431":["Molecular orbital theory is a way of understanding how the electrons in a molecule are arranged and how they behave. It helps us predict things like the shape of the molecule and how stable it is. \nImagine that you have a bunch of balls that you want to stack on top of each other. Each ball represents an electron. The balls are attracted to each other because of the electrical charge they carry, and they want to be as close together as possible. \nIn molecular orbital theory, we try to understand how the balls (electrons) are arranged in the stack (molecule) by creating \"orbital\" shapes that the balls can fit into. Each orbital can hold a certain number of balls, just like how a bucket can hold a certain number of marbles. \nThe shapes of the orbitals are determined by the behavior of the electrons in the molecule. Some orbitals are more stable than others, which means the balls (electrons) are less likely to fall out of them. This can help us understand why some molecules are more stable than others. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions."],"9542":["Steam is able to put games on sale at low prices because they have agreements with game developers and publishers to sell their games on their platform. When a game is put on sale, the developer and publisher still get paid a certain amount of money for each copy of the game that is sold, but the sale price is lower than the regular price. This can help attract more people to buy the game, which can ultimately lead to more sales overall.\r\n\r\nOne reason Steam is able to do this is because they have a large user base. Steam is one of the most popular platforms for buying and playing video games, and because of this, many game developers and publishers are willing to work with them to sell their games. This allows Steam to negotiate lower prices for the games that they sell and pass some of those savings on to customers.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that Steam is owned by Valve Corporation, a company that also develops and publishes its own video games. This means that Steam is able to make money from other sources besides just selling games, which helps them to be able to offer lower prices and still be profitable.\r\n\r\nOverall, Steam is able to put games on sale at low prices because they have a large user base and they have other sources of income, which allows them to negotiate lower prices with game developers and publishers and pass some of those savings on to customers."],"103":["A touchscreen works by using an electric current to detect when and where you touch the screen. The screen itself is made of a material that conducts electricity, and your finger is also a conductor of electricity. When you touch the screen with your finger, you interrupt the flow of electricity, and the phone's touchscreen can detect this interruption and figure out where on the screen you touched. \nA screen protector is made of a material that does not conduct electricity, so it does not interrupt the flow of electricity when you touch the screen. This is why you can still use a touchscreen with a screen protector on it. \nGloves, on the other hand, are made of insulating materials that do not conduct electricity. This means that when you touch the screen with a gloved finger, the flow of electricity is not interrupted, and the touchscreen cannot detect your touch. \nA stylus is a special pen-like tool that you can use to write or draw on a touchscreen. It has a small, conductive tip that can interrupt the flow of electricity when you touch the screen with it. This allows the touchscreen to detect your touch even if you are using a stylus instead of your finger. \nConductive thread is a special type of thread that is made of a material that conducts electricity.

When you look in the mirror, you see yourself from a different angle and perspective than a camera does. The camera captures a 2D image of you, while you see yourself in 3D when you look in the mirror. This can cause differences in how you look in pictures versus how you see yourself in the mirror. Another reason you might feel this way is that pictures can be more critical than mirrors. When you look in the mirror, you might not focus on small details or blemishes because you see yourself every day and are used to how you look. But when you see a picture of yourself, it can be easy to focus on small details or imperfections that you might not notice when you see yourself in the mirror.

Inflation is when the prices of goods and services go up because there is more money in circulation. If a country prints too much money, the value of that money can go down, because there is so much of it. This means that it takes more money to buy the same things, which can make it harder for people to afford the things they need.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that printing more money can lead to a decrease in the value of a country's currency. If a country's currency becomes less valuable, it can be harder for the country to trade with other countries, because their goods and services will be more expensive to other countries.\r\n\r\nIn short, while printing more money might seem like an easy way to make a country wealthier, it can actually have negative consequences and is not a sustainable way to improve a country's economy."],"10862":["If a person who has been acquitted of a murder (found not guilty in a court of law) confesses to the crime after the verdict, it would not change the outcome of the trial. The person would not be able to be tried again for the same crime, due to a legal principle known as \"double jeopardy,\" which prevents someone from being tried twice for the same crime.\r\n\r\nHowever, the person's confession could potentially lead to further legal consequences, such as being charged with perjury (lying under oath) if they testified in their own defense during the trial and denied committing the crime. It could also lead to civil litigation, where the family of the victim could file a lawsuit against the person for damages.\r\n\r\nIn general, it is always best to tell the truth and be honest, especially in a court of law.

A time signature with a top number of 2, like 2\/2 or 2\/4, means that there are two beats in a measure. A time signature with a top number of 4, like 4\/4 or 3\/4, means that there are four beats in a measure.\\n\\nIn a piece of music written in 2\/2 time, each measure would have two beats, and each beat would be the length of a half note. In a piece of music written in 4\/4 time, each measure would also have two beats, but each beat would be the length of a quarter note.\\n\\nSo, even though both 2\/2 and 4\/4 have the same number of beats per measure, the notes that get the beat are different lengths. This can affect the way the music feels and how fast or slow it is played.\\n\\nFor example, if a piece of music is meant to be played very slowly and smoothly, 2\/2 time might be a good choice because the half notes will last longer and give the music a more relaxed feel. On the other hand, if a piece of music is meant to be played quickly and with a lot of energy, 4\/4 time might be a better choice because the shorter quarter notes will give the music a more energetic feel."],"7021":["Therapy is a process where people talk about their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors with a trained mental health professional. It can help people with anxiety, personality disorders, and other mental health conditions because it gives them a safe space to explore their emotions and learn coping skills. For example, if someone has anxiety, they might talk about what makes them anxious and work with the therapist to come up with strategies to manage their anxiety. If someone has borderline personality disorder, they might talk about their relationships and work on ways to communicate more effectively with others. The therapist can also teach people relaxation techniques and help them identify unhealthy patterns in their thinking.Overall, therapy can be very helpful in improving mental health and helping people live happier, healthier lives.

They work by allowing the expanding gases that are produced when a bullet is fired to cool and dissipate before they are released from the end of the barrel. The idea of using a device to suppress the noise of a firearm dates back to the early 20th century. In 1909, Hiram Percy Maxim, the son of Hiram Stevens Maxim who invented the first machine gun, invented the first silencer. He believed that the loud noise of firearms was a public nuisance and that a device to reduce the noise would make shooting safer and more pleasant for both the shooter and those around them. The Hollywood portrayal of silencers, where they make a gun almost completely silent, is largely fictional. In reality, silencers only reduce the noise of a gunshot, they do not eliminate it completely. The amount of noise reduction can vary depending on the type of firearm and the type of silencer being used, but a silencer typically reduces the noise of a gunshot by about 20 to 35 decibels, which is roughly the same as the noise level of a loud conversation. Despite the limitations of silencers, they are still useful for a variety of purposes, such as hunting, shooting at a shooting range, or for use by law enforcement or military personnel in situations where the noise of a gunshot could be a liability."],"3907":["Scientific racism is the use of scientific techniques and theories to support the belief that some races are superior to others.

This can be especially true if they are tired, hungry, or feeling overwhelmed by all the new sights and sounds. It can also be difficult for children to adapt to new rules or expectations, such as following rules at a hotel or behaving differently in a new culture.\n\nIt's important to remember that children, especially young ones, often don't have the same coping skills or self-control as adults, so they may have a harder time managing their emotions and behavior when they are in a new place. It's also important to consider that children may be experiencing stress or anxiety about being in a new place, which can affect their behavior.\n\nTo help manage your child's behavior while traveling, it's important to try to maintain as much of their normal routine as possible, such as sticking to regular meal times and bedtimes. It can also be helpful to give your child plenty of breaks and opportunities to rest, and to make sure they are well-fed and hydrated. Providing plenty of positive reinforcement and praising good behavior can also be helpful in encouraging your child to behave well while traveling."],"6795":["When an object moves through a medium, like air or water, it creates pressure waves that travel through that medium. The speed at which these pressure waves travel is called the speed of sound. The speed of sound is different in different materials and it depends on the temperature, humidity, and pressure of the medium.On Earth, the speed of sound in air is about 340 meters per second, or about 767 miles per hour. When an object, like an airplane, moves through the air and reaches the speed of sound, it creates a shock wave that travels through the air. This shock wave is what creates the loud \"boom\" sound that we often hear when an airplane breaks the sound barrier.In space, there is no air or other medium for sound waves to travel through, so there is no way for an object to break the sound barrier. Instead, the speed of an object in space is measured by how fast it is moving relative to other objects, rather than how fast it is moving through a medium. So, even if an object in space were moving much faster than the speed of sound, it would not create a sonic boom or any other type of sound."],"5573":["Diet soda may not have any calories, but it still contains artificial sweeteners, which can affect your body in a number of ways. One theory is that these sweeteners can change the way your body processes and stores sugar, leading to weight gain. Some research has suggested that people who drink diet soda may be more likely to eat more later, which can also contribute to weight gain.\\n\\nAnother theory is that artificial sweeteners can interfere with the way your body regulates appetite, making you feel hungrier and causing you to eat more. They may also affect your body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels, which can cause you to feel hungry even when you're not.\\n\\nIt's important to note that not all research has found a link between diet soda and weight gain, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between diet soda and weight. However, if you're concerned about your weight, it's generally a good idea to limit your intake of diet soda and other artificially sweetened beverages, and focus on drinking water, unsweetened tea, and other low-calorie beverages instead."],"2207":["Sure! A clutch is a part of a car's engine that helps the car switch between gears while driving. It's kind of like a switch that can turn off and on the power between the engine and the wheels. Imagine you are riding your bike and you want to go faster. To do that, you have to pedal harder, right? But if you pedal too hard, the bike will go too fast and it might be hard to control. The same thing happens in a car. The engine is like the pedals on a bike, and the gears are like different speeds you can choose. When you shift to a higher gear, it's like pedaling harder on your bike. But if you shift too quickly, the car might jerk or shake. The clutch helps make shifting gears smoother. When you press down on the clutch pedal, it \"disconnects\" the engine from the wheels, kind of like how you might take your foot off the pedals on your bike to coast. This makes it easier to shift gears without the car jerking or shaking. When you release the clutch pedal, the engine and the wheels are \"connected\" again, and the car starts moving. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"16776":["Cuts usually heal faster when they are exposed to open air because the air helps to dry out the wound and kill any germs that might be present. When a cut is covered with a bandaid, it can become moist and warm, which is the perfect environment for bacteria to grow. This can lead to an infection, which can slow down the healing process.\n\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind that some cuts may be too deep or too dirty to be left open to the air. In these cases, it's best to cover the wound with a bandaid or some other type of dressing to keep it clean and protected. Your body's immune system will then work to fight off any infections and help the wound to heal.\n\nSo, in general, it's good to let a cut heal in open air if it's not too deep or dirty. But if it is, it's better to cover it up to keep it clean and protected while it heals."],"14392":["There are a few reasons why some people are upset about Facebook buying Oculus. Here are a few: 1.

It can be described by a set of rules or equations that tell us how the system will change as time goes on.\n\nA dynamical system model with two orthogonal rotations in state space means that there are two different ways in which the system can change. One way changes very quickly, while the other changes more slowly.\n\nFor example, imagine a toy top that you can spin. The top is a dynamical system, because it changes over time as it spins. If you give the top a little push, it will start to spin around, and it will keep spinning until it slows down and stops. The top has two different ways it can change: it can spin around its center (the high frequency rotation), and it can also tilt back and forth as it spins (the low frequency rotation). These two rotations are orthogonal, which means they are perpendicular to each other.\n\nSo, a dynamical system model with two orthogonal rotations in state space is like a toy top that can spin and tilt at the same time. It's a way of describing how the system changes over time and how it is affected by different factors."],"7154":["There are actually many cities around the world that have vibrant music scenes and are home to emerging bands.

However, that doesn't mean that there aren't plenty of amazing new artists out there making great music."],"2636":["Sure! Bacteria are tiny living things that can sometimes make people sick. They can also sometimes become resistant to the drugs that are used to kill them. This means that the drugs don't work as well as they used to, and the bacteria can continue to grow and multiply even when people are taking the drugs to try to stop them. Bacteria can become resistant to drugs in a few different ways. One way is through mutation, which is when the bacteria's genes change in some way. These changes can sometimes make the bacteria stronger and more able to survive even when they are exposed to drugs. Another way that bacteria can become resistant to drugs is by sharing genetic material with other bacteria. This is called horizontal gene transfer, and it can allow bacteria to get new genes that help them survive even when they are exposed to drugs. To defeat potential pandemics, it is important to take steps to prevent the spread of bacteria and to use drugs wisely. This can include washing your hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, and not taking antibiotics unless they are prescribed by a doctor. It is also important to research and develop new drugs that can kill bacteria and help to prevent the spread of resistance."],"5444":["Female genital mutilation (FGM) and male circumcision are two very different procedures. FGM involves the partial or complete removal of the female genitalia for non-medical reasons. It is a harmful practice that is often carried out on young girls and can cause serious physical and emotional harm. It is illegal in many countries because it is considered a form of violence against women and girls and is seen as a violation of their human rights.\\n\\nMale circumcision, on the other hand, is the surgical removal of the foreskin, which is a layer of skin that covers the head of the penis. It is often performed for religious or cultural reasons, and in some cases, it may have medical benefits, such as reducing the risk of certain infections. However, it is important to note that male circumcision is not necessary for good health and that it is a personal decision that should be made by the individual or their parent or guardian.\\n\\nIn short, female genital mutilation is banned because it is harmful and violates the rights of women and girls, while male circumcision is not banned because it is not considered to be harmful in the same way and is often a matter of personal choice.\\n"],"11208":["NASA launches from Cape Canaveral, Florida, which is close to the equator, because it helps the rocket save fuel. When a rocket launches, it needs to use a lot of fuel to lift off the ground and escape Earth's gravity. Launching from the equator gives the rocket a boost because Earth is spinning faster at the equator than it is at the poles. This means that a rocket launching from the equator is already moving faster than a rocket launching from a place further north or south. This extra speed helps the rocket use less fuel to get into space.\r\n\r\nWhile it might seem like launching from a high altitude location like the Rockies would be easier because the air is thinner, there are actually several other factors that make it more difficult. For example, the Rocky Mountains are much further from the equator, so the rocket wouldn't get the same boost from Earth's rotation. Additionally, the thin air at high altitudes can make it harder for the rocket to lift off the ground and can cause other problems during the launch.\r\n\r\nOverall, the combination of the boost from Earth's rotation and the fact that Cape Canaveral has a lot of infrastructure (like launch pads and control centers) already in place makes it a good choice for launching rockets."],"15434":["Sure! I can try to explain this concept in a way that is easy to understand.\n\nCorrelation means that two things are related in some way. For example, if you eat ice cream every day and you also get a sunburn every day, you might think that eating ice cream causes sunburns. However, this is not necessarily true. There might be another reason that these two things are happening at the same time.\n\nCausation means that one thing is causing another thing to happen. In the example I just gave, if you really wanted to know if eating ice cream causes sunburns, you would have to do an experiment. You could give some people ice cream every day and see if they get sunburned, and then give other people something else to eat every day and see if they get sunburned. If the people who eat ice cream every day are more likely to get sunburned, then you might conclude that eating ice cream causes sunburns.\n\nSo, the phrase \"correlation does not imply causation\" means that just because two things seem to be related, it doesn't mean that one thing is causing the other. You need to do more research and experimentation to understand the true relationship between two things. Does that help?"],"124":["In general, major sporting events like football and basketball games are free to watch on TV because they are broadcast by networks that have paid for the rights to show the games. These networks make money by selling advertisements during the broadcasts. \nOn the other hand, many boxing and MMA events are pay-per-view (PPV) events, which means that people have to pay to watch them on TV. This is because the organizers of these events have made arrangements with cable and satellite companies to show the events on PPV, and the money from the PPV fees goes to the organizers and the fighters. \nOne reason that boxing and MMA events might be more likely to be PPV is that they tend to be less popular than football and basketball, and therefore don't attract as many viewers or as much advertising money. As a result, the organizers of these events may need to charge a fee in order to cover their costs and make a profit."],"13081":["Traditional wisdom dictates that whites should be washed in hot water because hot water is more effective at removing dirt, stains, and bacteria from clothing than cold water. Hot water helps to loosen and dissolve dirt and stains, making it easier for detergents to lift them away from the fabric. In addition, hot water can kill certain types of bacteria that may be present on clothing, which can help to keep the clothes fresh and hygienic. However, it's important to note that not all clothing can be washed in hot water. Some fabrics, such as wool and silk, are more delicate and can shrink or become damaged if washed in hot water. In these cases, it's best to use cold water to avoid damaging the clothes. To explain it like you're five, hot water is really good at cleaning clothes because it helps to get rid of all the yucky stuff that gets stuck on them, like dirt and stains. But sometimes, clothes are made out of special materials that can't handle hot water, so we have to be careful and use cold water instead."],"14758":["Great question!

Its members are known as Freemasons. Freemasonry is based on the idea of brotherhood and helping each other, and it teaches moral lessons using stories and symbols from stonemasonry and other sources. Freemasonry is not a religion, but it does have some similarities to religion in that it has a set of moral values and holds ceremonies.\r\n\r\nFreemasonry is sometimes thought of as \"influent\" because it has a long history and has had many famous and influential members, including kings, presidents, and business leaders.

Many people join Freemasonry to make friends, learn new things, and give back to their community through charitable work."],"9854":["In the video you mentioned, the person is using a device called a \"vaporizing alcohol\" or \"vaportini\" to inhale alcohol vapor. These devices consist of a small glass globe with a stem and a heating element, which is used to heat up and vaporize the alcohol.\r\n\r\nTo use a vaportini, you first pour a small amount of alcohol (such as vodka) into the glass globe. Then, you light the heating element and wait for the alcohol to vaporize. As the alcohol vaporizes, it creates a cloud of vapor that can be inhaled through the stem of the globe.\r\n\r\nThis process is sometimes called \"smoking\" alcohol, but it is not the same as smoking tobacco. When you smoke tobacco, you burn the leaves and inhale the smoke, which contains harmful chemicals and carcinogens. Inhaling alcohol vapor is different because you are not actually burning the alcohol, you are just vaporizing it. However, inhaling alcohol vapor can still be dangerous because it can lead to alcohol poisoning or other health risks."],"14037":["Ebola is a very serious and deadly virus that can cause a high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, and tiredness, as well as vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding. It is spread through contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person, or with objects (like needles) that have been contaminated with the virus. The virus can also be spread through the air when people are in close contact (for example, when caring for or burying someone who is sick with Ebola). There is currently no cure for Ebola, but there are ways to help people who are sick with the virus feel better and increase their chances of surviving. These include giving them fluids to help prevent dehydration, and treating their symptoms (like fever, headache, and pain). Scientists are also working on developing vaccines to prevent people from getting infected with the virus, and medications to treat people who have already been infected. One reason that it has been difficult to develop a cure for Ebola is that the virus is very complex and can change (mutate) over time. This makes it harder for scientists to study and understand how the virus works, and to find ways to stop it from causing illness. Additionally, Ebola outbreaks are often in areas with limited resources and infrastructure, which can make it harder to get the medical care and supplies that people need. Overall, finding a cure for Ebola is a very challenging task, but scientists and medical professionals are working hard to find ways to prevent and treat the virus, and to protect people from getting infected."],"13918":["There are a few different reasons why a company might choose to buy out another company for more than they will make back. One reason is that the company being bought out may have valuable assets or intellectual property that the buying company wants to acquire. For example, Yahoo might have wanted to buy Tumblr because Tumblr had a large user base and a popular platform for blogging and social networking. Similarly, Microsoft might have wanted to buy Minecraft because it is a very popular and successful video game with a large and dedicated player base. Another reason a company might choose to buy out another company is to expand its reach or capabilities. By acquiring another company, the buying company can gain access to new markets, customers, or technologies that it didn't have before. This can help the buying company grow and become more competitive in its industry. Finally, a company might choose to buy out another company simply because it believes that the company is undervalued and has the potential to become much more valuable in the future. In this case, the buying company is willing to pay more upfront in order to potentially reap larger rewards down the line. Overall, there are many different factors that can influence a company's decision to buy out another company, and the specific reasons will vary depending on the specific situation."],"15125":["The Higgs boson is a subatomic particle that is named after physicist Peter Higgs, who proposed its existence in 1964. It is sometimes referred to as the \"God particle\" because it is associated with a field that gives other particles mass, and its discovery was considered a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe.\n\nTo understand how the Higgs boson gives matter mass, it's helpful to think about how particles interact with each other. Imagine you are a ball rolling on a frictionless surface. If there is nothing in your way, you can keep rolling forever. But if you encounter something like a wall, the wall will exert a force on you, slowing you down and eventually stopping you. The wall has mass, and it can transfer some of that mass to you through this interaction.\n\nNow imagine that the frictionless surface is actually a field, like an invisible sea of energy. The Higgs field is a bit like this. It is an energy field that fills all of space, and it can interact with other particles, giving them mass.\n\nParticles with mass, like the wall in our example, can pass through the Higgs field without much resistance. But particles without mass, like photons of light, can pass through the field without interacting with it at all. This is why light has no mass, even though it is made up of particles called photons.\n\nThe Higgs boson is a particle that is associated with the Higgs field. It is like a ripple in the field, and it can transfer some of the field's energy to other particles, giving them mass. This is how the Higgs boson gives matter mass.

A supernova is a huge explosion that happens when a star runs out of fuel and collapses. When this happens, the star's core (the very center) becomes really dense and hot, and it explodes outward, releasing a huge amount of energy. A neutron star is formed when a star that is much bigger than our Sun collapses and explodes in a supernova. When this happens, the outer layers of the star are blasted off, leaving behind a super-dense core made up of neutrons (tiny particles that make up the nucleus of an atom). These neutron stars are super dense and very small, often only about the size of a city, but they have a lot of mass and are extremely dense. A black hole is a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Black holes are formed when a star collapses and becomes so dense that it creates a \"point of no return,\" called the event horizon. Anything that falls into the event horizon will be trapped there forever. Black holes can also be created when a lot of mass, such as a cluster of stars, is packed into a very small space. So, to sum it up: A supernova is a huge explosion that happens when a star collapses. A neutron star is a super-dense, super-massive object that is formed when a star collapses and explodes. A black hole is a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape from it. It is created when a star collapses or when a lot of mass is packed into a very small space. I hope that helps!

These policies can include things like cutting back on social services and welfare programs, reducing government employee salaries and benefits, and selling off government-owned assets. Austerity measures are often implemented during times of economic hardship, when governments are struggling to pay their bills and need to find ways to save money.\n\nAusterity can have a number of effects on people, both positive and negative. On the positive side, it can help to reduce government debt and improve the overall financial stability of a country. On the negative side, it can lead to reduced access to important services, such as healthcare and education, and can also lead to increased unemployment and poverty, as government spending cuts often result in job losses.\n\nOverall, the idea behind austerity is to make the government more financially responsible by reducing spending and increasing revenue. However, the specific policies that are implemented as part of an austerity program can have a wide range of consequences for the people living in the country, and there is often debate about whether the benefits of these policies outweigh the costs."],"15239":["Drinking hot tea in the summer can actually make you feel cooler because it can cause your body to sweat. When your body sweats, it releases moisture through your skin, and this evaporation process helps to cool your body down.\n\nImagine that you are a glass of water. If you are left out in a hot room, the heat from the room will cause the water to evaporate, or turn into a gas. This process absorbs heat, and as a result, the glass of water will feel cool to the touch.\n\nThe same thing happens when you sweat. The heat from your body causes the sweat on your skin to evaporate, and this process helps to cool your body down. So, when you drink hot tea in the summer, your body sweats more, and the evaporation of this sweat helps to cool you down.\n\nIt's important to note that this only works if you are in a place with good air circulation.

They both grow from an area called the matrix, which is located beneath the cuticle at the base of the nail. The matrix produces new cells, which push the older cells forward and cause the nail to grow. The speed at which your nails grow depends on a few different factors, including your age, your diet, and your overall health.\n\nOne reason why your fingernails might grow faster than your toenails is because the matrix for your fingernails is located deeper in your finger than the matrix for your toenails is located in your toes. This means that the matrix for your fingernails has more access to nutrients and blood flow, which can help them grow faster.\n\nAnother reason is that your toes are usually enclosed in shoes, which can make it harder for the nails to get the oxygen and nutrients they need to grow. On the other hand, your fingers are exposed to the air more, which can help them grow faster.\n\nOverall, there isn't a single reason why your fingernails might grow faster than your toenails.

I'd be happy to help explain this to you.When you take out a mortgage to buy a house, you are borrowing money from a bank to pay for the house. The bank charges you interest on the money you borrow, which is a percentage of the total amount of the mortgage. The interest rate is the percentage of the mortgage that you have to pay to the bank in addition to the amount you borrowed.When you make a mortgage payment, a portion of the payment goes towards paying off the principal, or the amount of money you borrowed. The rest of the payment goes towards paying the interest, which is the cost of borrowing the money.So, for example, if you have a mortgage with a 4.5% interest rate and you make a payment of $1000, a portion of that payment will go towards paying off the principal and the rest will go towards paying the interest. The exact amount that goes towards each will depend on the terms of your mortgage and how much you owe on the loan.Over time, as you make more and more mortgage payments, the amount you owe on the loan (the principal) will gradually decrease, and the amount of interest you owe will gradually decrease as well.

In the United States, the progressive tax system is designed to reduce income inequality by taking a larger percentage of income from people who are more able to pay, and using that money to fund programs and services that benefit the entire population, such as education, healthcare, and social security. \nHowever, there are still many factors that can contribute to inequality in the United States, even with a progressive tax system in place. For example, some people may have access to better education and job opportunities, which can lead to higher incomes. Additionally, there may be systemic biases and discrimination that make it more difficult for certain groups of people to advance in their careers or earn as much as others. \nFinally, the overall distribution of wealth in a society, rather than just income, also plays a role in inequality. Wealth, or the total value of a person's assets (such as their savings, investments, and property), can be passed down from generation to generation, which can create a more unequal distribution of resources over time. \nOverall, while a progressive tax system can help to reduce inequality, it is just one factor among many that contribute to the overall level of inequality in a society."],"481":["Acne is a common skin condition that occurs when the hair follicles on your skin become clogged with oil and dead skin cells.

When germs enter your body, your immune system works to identify and attack them, helping you stay healthy.\n\nIt is also important to note that not all the water in lakes, ponds, and oceans contains viruses and bacteria. While it is true that some of these bodies of water may contain germs that can cause illness, the risk of becoming sick from swimming in them is generally low if you are healthy.\n\nOverall, while it is possible to become sick from swimming in a lake, pond, or ocean, your body's natural defenses and immune system can help protect you from illness."],"12385":["EST stands for Eastern Standard Time. It is a time zone that is used as a reference for scheduling events and broadcasts. The reason it is often used as a standard is because it is one of the most populous time zones in the United States, and many people and businesses in the eastern part of the country use EST as their primary time zone. When an event or program is scheduled to be broadcast at 8PM EST, it means that it will be shown at 8PM for people who live in the EST time zone. For people who live in other time zones, the actual time that the event or program will be shown may be different. For example, if you live in the Central Standard Time (CST) zone, which is one hour behind EST, the event or program will be shown at 7PM for you. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"6989":["There are many companies that sell gold because it is a valuable commodity and people are willing to buy it. Some people buy gold as an investment because they believe that it will increase in value over time, while others buy gold because they think it is a safe place to store their money. The banks that you mentioned might be buying gold to hold in their own reserves, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is a good investment for everyone. It's important for people to do their own research and make sure that buying gold is the right decision for them before making a purchase."],"808":["In a criminal trial, the defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty. The prosecution, or the side that is trying to prove that the defendant is guilty, is responsible for presenting evidence and witness testimony to show that the defendant committed the crime. The defense, or the side representing the defendant, is responsible for challenging the prosecution's evidence and presenting their own evidence and arguments to try to show that the defendant is not guilty. \nAs part of this process, the defense lawyer is not responsible for asking the defendant whether they committed the crime. Instead, the lawyer's job is to present a defense for the defendant, which may include questioning the prosecution's evidence and witnesses, presenting evidence and witness testimony on behalf of the defendant, and making legal arguments to try to show that the defendant is not guilty. \nThis process is in place to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial. It allows the defendant to have an advocate who can present a defense on their behalf, and it also helps to protect against wrongful convictions by requiring the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt."],"9021":["Heat can cause things to change shape or become distorted because heat causes molecules to move around more quickly. When molecules move around more quickly, they tend to take up more space. This can cause an object to become larger or to change shape.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you put a metal spoon in a fire, the heat from the fire will cause the molecules in the spoon to move around more quickly. As the molecules move around more quickly, they will start to take up more space, which can cause the spoon to become bent or distorted.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens with things like exhaust pipes on cars and fireplaces. The heat from the exhaust or the fire can cause the metal or other materials to become distorted or change shape.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps to explain it! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"14303":["The testicles are held in place inside the scrotum by a series of muscles and ligaments that help to keep them in position. These muscles and ligaments allow the testicles to move slightly within the scrotum, but they do not allow them to become twisted or tangled together. The scrotum is a sac of skin that hangs outside of the body and contains the testicles. The testicles are held in place within the scrotum by a series of muscles and ligaments that help to keep them in position. These muscles and ligaments allow the testicles to move slightly within the scrotum, but they do not allow them to become twisted or tangled together. In addition, the testicles are shaped in a way that makes it difficult for them to become twisted or tangled together. They are oval-shaped and have a smooth surface, which helps to prevent them from becoming tangled or twisted. Overall, the muscles, ligaments, and shape of the testicles work together to help keep them in place and prevent them from becoming twisted or tangled together inside the scrotum."],"14272":["People duck when approaching a helicopter because the helicopter blades can be very dangerous. Even though the blades are high up, they can still hit someone if they are not careful. It is especially important for people like soldiers, police, and government agents to be careful around helicopters because they often have to work near them. Ducking helps them avoid being hit by the blades, which could cause serious injury or even death."],"7553":["Ancient sailors used the stars as a way to navigate on the open ocean because they are a relatively stable reference point in the sky. Even though the stars are moving and expanding, their movements are so slow and imperceptible to us on Earth that they can be used as a fixed reference for navigation.To use the stars for navigation, sailors would first need to know which direction is north. They could use a simple device called a \"mariner's compass\" to determine north. Once they knew which direction was north, they could use certain bright stars in the sky to determine their location and the direction they needed to go.For example, the North Star, also known as Polaris, is a bright star that is located almost directly above the Earth's North Pole. If a sailor knew where the North Star was in the sky, they could use it to determine which direction was north. They could then use other bright stars in the sky to determine their location and the direction they needed to go to reach their destination.Overall, using the stars for navigation is a reliable way for ancient sailors to find their way across the open ocean, even though the stars are moving and expanding."],"1593":["It is unfortunate that some people who called themselves Christians throughout history have used the Bible to justify actions that were not in line with the values of Christianity, including the enslavement of other human beings. \nThe story of the Israelites being enslaved in Egypt, as told in the Bible, is meant to teach us about God's faithfulness and power to rescue his people from difficult circumstances. It is not meant to be used as a justification for enslaving others. \nIt is important to remember that the Bible teaches us to love our neighbors and to treat others with kindness and respect. Enslaving other people goes against these values. \nIt is also important to recognize that the people who engaged in the slave trade were influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural and economic considerations. They may have justified their actions in various ways, but these justifications do not excuse the harm and suffering caused by the slave trade."],"13318":["Sexual orientation is a complex trait that is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While identical twins share the same genes, they may still experience different things in the environment that can influence their sexual orientation. It is not uncommon for identical twins to have different sexual orientations, just as it is not uncommon for fraternal twins or siblings who do not share the same genes to have different sexual orientations. It is important to remember that no two people are exactly alike, and that includes identical twins."],"9047":["Backwards compatibility refers to the ability of a newer gaming console to play games that were made for an older console. Adding backwards compatibility to a console is not as simple as just adding some code, because it requires the new console to be able to run games that were designed to work on a different hardware platform.\r\n\r\nIn order to add backwards compatibility to a console, the manufacturer would need to create an emulator, which is a piece of software that can mimic the hardware of the older console and allow it to run on the newer hardware. This is a complex and time-consuming process, and it requires a lot of resources and development effort.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there may be other factors that make it difficult or impractical for a company to add backwards compatibility to a console. For example, the company may not have the rights to use certain older games on the new console, or there may be technical limitations that prevent certain games from running properly on the new hardware.\r\n\r\nUltimately, whether or not a company decides to add backwards compatibility to a console often comes down to business considerations, such as the cost of development versus the potential benefits to the company and its customers."],"7588":["When people smoke cigarettes, they inhale nicotine, which is a drug that can be addictive. However, even though someone may be addicted to nicotine, they are still able to sleep just like anyone else. When we sleep, our bodies and brains rest and recharge. While we sleep, our brains do not focus on our desires or cravings for things like cigarettes. Instead, they are busy with other important tasks, like helping us to dream and to process and store memories. So, even though someone who smokes cigarettes may have a strong desire to smoke when they are awake, that desire is not as strong when they are asleep, and it does not wake them up."],"4002":["It's possible that more comedians lean left because there are simply more people who are interested in comedy and who are also left-leaning. It could also be that being a comedian requires a certain type of personality or way of thinking, and this type of personality is more common among left-leaning people. Finally, it could be that the entertainment industry as a whole tends to be more left-leaning, and so it attracts more left-leaning comedians. It's important to note that there are many different factors that can contribute to this phenomenon and that it's not necessarily the case that left-leaning people are funnier than right-leaning people."],"14540":["Communicating with an alien civilization would be a very challenging task, as it is difficult to know in advance what kinds of language and communication systems they might use. Here are a few ways that we might try to decode their language and communicate with them: 1. Use context clues: If we are able to observe the aliens in their natural environment, we might be able to infer the meanings of their words or gestures based on the context in which they are used. For example, if an alien makes a certain sound and then picks up a piece of food, we might infer that the sound means \"food.\" 2. Use nonverbal communication: Even if we are not able to understand each other's spoken or written languages, we might be able to communicate through nonverbal means such as gestures, facial expressions, or physical actions. 3. Use visual aids: We might try to use visual aids such as diagrams, drawings, or other forms of representation to help convey information and ideas. 4. Use a universal translator: In science fiction, it is often depicted that a universal translator is used to instantly translate between different languages. While this technology does not yet exist in reality, it is possible that we might develop some kind of device or software that is able to translate between different languages in the future. Overall, communicating with an alien civilization would likely involve a combination of different strategies and approaches, and would require patience, creativity, and an open mind."],"14537":["There is a stereotype in movies, games, and books that larger things or people are not as agile as smaller things or people because it is generally easier for smaller things or people to move quickly and change direction than it is for larger things or people. This is because larger things or people have more mass, which means they have more weight and it takes more effort for them to move their bodies. Imagine trying to run and change direction quickly while carrying a heavy backpack. It would be more difficult for you to do that than if you were not carrying the backpack. It's the same idea for larger people or things. They have more mass, so it is harder for them to move quickly and change direction."],"15421":["Wearing underwear can have a number of benefits for both males and females. Here are a few reasons why people might choose to wear underwear:\n\nProtection: Underwear can provide a layer of protection for your genitals and anus from external irritants, such as rough fabrics or abrasions.\n\nSupport: Underwear can provide support for the genitals, which can be especially important for males during physical activity.\n\nHygiene: Wearing underwear can help to keep the area around your genitals clean and dry, which can help to prevent infections and other health issues.\n\nModesty: Underwear can provide a layer of coverage that can help to prevent accidental exposure of your genitals in public.\n\nComfort: Some people find that wearing underwear helps to keep them comfortable and prevent chafing or irritation.\n\nIt's important to note that different cultures and societies may have different attitudes towards underwear, and some people may choose not to wear it for personal or cultural reasons. Ultimately, whether or not to wear underwear is a personal choice that each individual can make based on their own needs and preferences."],"5939":["Computer viruses are created and spread for many reasons. Some people create viruses to cause harm to other people's computers, while others create them for personal gain, such as stealing sensitive information or using other people's computers to do things like send spam emails.

Viruses can be very harmful and can cause damage to computer software, which is why it is important to protect your computer with antivirus software."],"16504":["Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is a thought experiment, which means it's a way of thinking about something that is not actually done in real life. It was created by a scientist named Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger to help explain a strange idea in physics called superposition.\n\nIn the thought experiment, a cat is put in a box with a device that could kill the cat at any moment. According to the rules of superposition, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time until the box is opened and we see if the cat is alive or dead. This seems strange, but it helps to explain how particles, like atoms, can be in two different states at the same time.\n\nThe thought experiment does not have any actual results because it is not a real experiment. It is just a way of thinking about something that is hard to understand. However, the idea of superposition has been tested and shown to be true in many experiments with particles, like atoms and electrons."],"7344":["Wrecking balls and other demolition equipment often spray water while they are in use to help control dust and debris. When a building is being demolished, the impact of the wrecking ball or other demolition tool can create a lot of dust and debris, which can be harmful to the workers and anyone in the surrounding area.Spraying water can help to suppress the dust and keep it from spreading, which can improve air quality and make it easier for workers to see and move around the site. The water can also help to keep the demolition equipment itself clean and free from debris, which can help it to operate more efficiently.In some cases, the water may be sprayed from the top of the demolition equipment using a hydraulic system, which uses pressurized fluids to power various functions. This can make it easier to control the water spray and direct it where it is needed."],"13783":["Movies are generally around 1.5 to 2 hours long because that is a good length for telling a story and keeping the audience's attention. If a movie is too short, it may not have enough time to fully develop the plot and characters. On the other hand, if a movie is too long, it may become boring or hard to follow. The length of a movie is usually determined by the story being told and how much time is needed to tell it properly. Some stories may require more time to be told effectively, while others may be able to be told in a shorter amount of time. It's also worth noting that the length of a movie can vary depending on the genre. For example, some action movies or thrillers may be shorter in length because they rely more on fast-paced action and less on character development or plot. On the other hand, dramas or comedies may be longer because they focus more on character development and relationships. Overall, the length of a movie is not set in stone and can vary based on the needs of the story being told."],"2907":["Deconstruction is a way of analyzing and interpreting texts, particularly literary texts. When you read literature from a deconstructive viewpoint, you might focus on the ways in which the text undermines or challenges its own meanings and assumptions. One way to think about deconstruction is to consider the different layers of meaning that a text might have. For example, a novel might have a surface level meaning, which is the story that is being told. But when you read the novel from a deconstructive viewpoint, you might also consider the deeper meanings and implications of the text. This might include looking at how the text is structured, the language it uses, and the ways in which it presents ideas and themes. Another important aspect of deconstruction is to consider the context in which the text was written and how this might influence its meanings. For example, you might consider the cultural, historical, and social context in which the text was written, and how this might shape the ideas and themes that the text presents. Overall, the goal of deconstruction is to carefully examine a text and consider all of the different meanings and implications it might have, rather than simply accepting the surface level meaning at face value. This can help you gain a deeper understanding of the text and the ideas it presents."],"7590":["I'm sorry, but you haven't provided me with enough information to understand what you are asking about.

However, your stomach is designed to handle this mixture and keep the acid separate from the water.\\n\\nYour stomach has a special lining called the mucosa, which protects the stomach wall from the strong acid. The mucosa also produces a special type of mucus that coats the stomach and helps to neutralize the acid. This helps to protect the stomach wall and keep the acid from coming into contact with the rest of the body.\\n\\nIn addition, your stomach has a special sphincter muscle at the top called the esophageal sphincter, which acts like a one-way valve. It prevents the stomach acid from flowing back up into your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach). This helps to keep the acid in your stomach, where it belongs, and prevents it from coming into contact with the rest of your body.\\n\\nSo, to answer your question, the body separates water from stomach acid by using the mucosa, the mucus it produces, and the esophageal sphincter to keep the acid contained in the stomach and prevent it from coming into contact with the rest of the body."],"13198":["Sometimes kids can be mean to each other because they are trying to figure out how to act and what is and is not acceptable behavior. They may not have learned yet how to express their own feelings or handle their own emotions in a healthy way, so they act out in negative ways. It's also possible that they may have learned this behavior from observing others around them, or they may be going through a phase where they are testing boundaries and trying to understand their own power. It's important for adults to help kids learn how to express themselves in positive ways and to teach them about empathy and kindness."],"9133":["Homosexuality is not a psychological disorder. This has been a conclusion of many medical and mental health organizations, including the American Psychiatric Association, which removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973.\r\n\r\nThere is no scientific evidence to support the idea that homosexuality is a disorder or a mental illness. In fact, research has shown that being gay is a normal part of human diversity and is not related to a person's mental health or emotional well-being.\r\n\r\nPeople who are attracted to people of the same sex are just as healthy, happy, and able to have fulfilling lives as anyone else. It is important to remember that everyone is unique and that it is okay to be different. It is never okay to discriminate against or mistreat someone because of their sexual orientation."],"5695":["There are a few reasons why people may have preferred Facebook over MySpace. One reason is that Facebook was more user-friendly and easier to navigate. It also had more robust privacy controls, which were important to many users. Additionally, Facebook had a more professional feel, which may have appealed to some people who wanted to use a social networking site for business or other professional purposes. Finally, Facebook had a larger user base, which meant that more people were able to connect with their friends and family on the platform. This may have made it more appealing to users who wanted to stay in touch with a larger network of people."],"8473":["When you save a file on your computer, it gets stored on your hard drive (or \"disk\") in a series of blocks. These blocks are like a bunch of little boxes that the file gets divided into and stored in.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when you delete a file or move it to a different place on your hard drive, it leaves behind empty blocks where the file used to be. If you save a new file, it might get divided into blocks and stored in those empty blocks.\r\n\r\nThis is what's called \"fragmentation.\" It's like a puzzle where the pieces are scattered all over the place instead of being next to each other. When the blocks of a file are scattered all over the hard drive, it takes the computer longer to find and open the file because it has to search for all the different blocks.\r\n\r\n\"Defragmenting\" is the process of organizing the blocks on the hard drive so that the files are stored in as few blocks as possible and in a way that makes it easy for the computer to find them. Defragmenting can make your computer run faster because it has to do less work to find and open files.\r\n\r\nTo defragment your hard drive, you can use a built-in tool on your computer or a special program. The process can take a while, depending on how big your hard drive is and how many files you have. But once it's finished, your computer should be able to find and open files more quickly."],"16860":["There are a few reasons why video games might cost more in Australia. One reason is that the cost of living in Australia is generally higher than in other countries, so things like video games might also be more expensive. Another reason is that video games are often priced in US dollars, and the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Australian dollar can fluctuate, which can affect the price of the game in Australia. Additionally, the cost of shipping and distributing video games to Australia can also be higher due to the distance, which can contribute to the higher price. Finally, there may be additional taxes or fees applied to video games in Australia that can increase the price."],"12022":["It's a tradition that dates back many centuries, and it's thought to have originated because ships were seen as valuable and important assets that needed to be cared for and protected. In the same way that people might refer to a valuable car or a treasured possession as \"she,\" ships have also been referred to using feminine pronouns. Another reason might be that ships were often given female names, and it became common to use feminine pronouns when referring to them. It's also worth noting that this tradition is not universal, and in some cultures and languages, ships are referred to using masculine pronouns."],"16247":["Ayn Rand was a philosopher and novelist who developed a philosophical system called \"Objectivism.\" Objectivism is based on the idea that the individual is the most important unit of society and that each person has the right to pursue their own happiness and own goals. Objectivism emphasizes rational thinking and individualism, and it argues that the government should not have the power to regulate people's lives or interfere with their pursuit of happiness.\n\nSome people criticize Ayn Rand's philosophy because they believe it is too focused on the individual and does not consider the needs of society as a whole. They also argue that her ideas about capitalism and individual rights are overly simplistic and do not take into account the complexities of real-world situations. Additionally, some people object to the way Rand's novels portray characters who embody her ideas, arguing that they are one-dimensional and do not reflect the complexity and nuance of real people.\n\nOverall, Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism has been controversial and has both supporters and detractors. Some people find her ideas inspiring and believe they offer a valuable perspective on individual freedom and personal responsibility, while others believe her ideas are misguided and harmful."],"14668":["Sure! The Office, Skins, and Being Human are all popular TV shows that were originally created and produced in the United Kingdom. When a TV show or movie is successful in one country, it is often remade or adapted for other countries so that people in those countries can also enjoy it. This is known as a \"remake\" or a \"reboot.\"\n\nSometimes, a remake will be very similar to the original, with only a few changes made to fit the cultural and societal differences of the new audience. Other times, the remake will be more different, with new characters, storylines, and settings that are more relevant to the new audience.\n\nThe purpose of remaking a TV show or movie for a different country is to introduce the story and characters to a new audience and potentially generate more revenue through ticket sales and merchandise. It can also be an opportunity for the creators of the original show to see how their concept is received by a new group of people and to potentially expand the reach and popularity of their work.\n\nI hope that helps to explain why TV shows like The Office, Skins, and Being Human are remade for the US. Let me know if you have any other questions!"],"19":["The sensation of falling in dreams is actually a very common experience and can be caused by a variety of factors. One reason people may experience this sensation is due to changes in their body position while they are sleeping. When you are lying down, your body is in a state of relative stillness. However, if you move or shift positions while you are sleeping, your body may perceive this movement as falling. This can trigger a reflex that causes you to feel like you are falling or to experience a sensation of vertigo. \nAnother reason people may experience the sensation of falling in their dreams is due to changes in their brain activity while they are sleeping. During the dreaming stage of sleep, known as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the brain is more active and may produce vivid and sometimes strange or surreal dreams. In some cases, the sensation of falling may be part of the dream content and may be related to the dreamer's feelings or emotions. \nFinally, the sensation of falling in dreams may be related to the way our brains process and interpret sensory information while we are asleep. During sleep, our brains are still receiving and processing sensory information from our surroundings, even though we are not consciously aware of it. This sensory information may be incorporated into our dreams and may contribute to the vividness and realism of the dream experience. \nOverall, the sensation of falling in dreams is a normal and common experience that is caused by a combination of factors related to body position, brain activity, and sensory processing during sleep."],"429":["There are a few reasons why some parents may not want to vaccinate their children. Some people may have concerns about the safety of vaccines or believe that they are not effective at preventing disease. Others may have religious or philosophical objections to vaccination. \nIt's important to understand that vaccines are very safe and have been proven to be effective at preventing serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Many of these diseases, such as measles and polio, are now rare in the United States because of vaccines. \nHowever, it's also important to respect the beliefs and decisions of others. If you have questions about vaccination, it's a good idea to talk to a trusted healthcare provider or do your own research to make an informed decision."],"5980":["Cookies are made from a mixture of ingredients like flour, butter, sugar, and eggs. When you bake a cookie, you are exposing it to heat, which causes the ingredients to change. The heat from the oven causes the butter to melt and the sugar to dissolve, which makes the dough smooth and easy to shape. The heat also causes the proteins in the flour to change and the dough to become stiff and solid. This is what makes it impossible to turn a baked cookie back into dough. On the other hand, mud and dirt are made from natural materials that can be mixed together and separated again without changing their chemical makeup.

The government of British Columbia also offers tax credits and other incentives to encourage movie and TV production in the province, which can help reduce the cost of making a film.\\n\\nOverall, there are many reasons why Vancouver is a popular place to film movies and TV shows, including its diverse locations, experienced crew, and financial incentives."],"4076":["North Korea is not completely shielded from the outside world and does have some limited access to the internet, although it is heavily restricted and monitored. It is also possible for people in North Korea to obtain information from other sources such as books and foreign media. However, it is important to note that the government of North Korea tightly controls the flow of information into and out of the country, and it is illegal for ordinary citizens to access information that is critical of the government. As for how North Korea has been able to make progress in fields like nuclear power, it is likely that they have relied on a combination of their own research and development, as well as information and technology that they have obtained from other countries. It is also possible that they have used illegal means to obtain sensitive information or technology. It is important to remember that the development and proliferation of nuclear weapons is a serious concern for the international community, and efforts are being made to prevent countries like North Korea from acquiring or improving their nuclear capabilities."],"5944":["Before computers, television studios used what are called \"graphics cards\" to create words and images on the screen. These graphics cards were physical cards with letters and symbols printed on them. The graphics team would arrange the cards to spell out the words they wanted to display on the screen. They would then hold the cards in front of the camera lens so that the words would appear on the screen. This was called \"teleprompting.\" It was a lot of work and took a lot of time to set up, but it was a good way to create words and images on the screen before computers were widely used in television production."],"8215":["National Parks are special places that are set aside for everyone to enjoy and explore. The government uses tax money to help maintain and improve these parks so that they can be enjoyed for years to come. Even though the government pays for some of the cost to run the parks, it is not enough to cover everything. That's where the entry fee comes in. The entry fee helps to pay for things like rangers, bathrooms, and trash cans, as well as other things that help keep the park running smoothly. It's kind of like when you go to a theme park or a concert and have to pay to get in.

Even if you can't directly buy a train from Norfolk Southern, you might still have an interest in learning more about the company and what it does. Advertising on television is a good way to reach a wide audience and get people talking about the company.Second, advertising can help these companies attract new customers or clients. Even though the general public might not be able to directly purchase a train from Norfolk Southern, they might still be able to do business with the company in other ways. For example, a business might hire Norfolk Southern to transport goods or materials, or an individual might invest in Norfolk Southern's stock. By advertising on television, Norfolk Southern can reach potential customers or clients who might be interested in working with the company in these ways.Finally, advertising can help these companies maintain and strengthen their relationships with existing customers or clients. If you are already a customer or client of Norfolk Southern or IBM, seeing an advertisement for the company on television can help you feel more connected to the brand and remind you of the products or services that are available."],"15883":["Video game save files work by storing information about the game's progress on your computer or console. This information can include which actions have been taken, what items are in the player's inventory, and other details about the game.\n\nTo track these things, the game uses a special kind of computer code called a \"programming language.\" When you play the game, the game's software runs on your computer or console and keeps track of all the actions you take and the items you collect. When you save your game, the software writes all of this information down in a special file called a \"save file.\"\n\nThe save file is like a snapshot of your game at a particular moment. It stores all of the information about what you have done so far and where you are in the game. When you load the save file, the game's software reads the information from the save file and uses it to restore the game to the exact same state it was in when you saved it.\n\nSo, when you play a video game, the save file helps the game remember all of the things you have done and where you are in the game, even if you turn off your computer or console or close the game."],"764":["Insects have many different ways of surviving the winter, depending on the species and the conditions in their environment. Some insects, like ladybugs and monarch butterflies, migrate to a warmer place for the winter. They fly to a new location where they can find food and shelter until the weather gets warmer again. \nOther insects, like bees and ants, stay in their nests or hives and huddle together to keep warm. They may also store food to eat during the winter when there isn't as much to find outside. \nSome insects, like moths and butterflies, lay their eggs in the fall, and the eggs hatch into larvae or caterpillars in the spring. The larvae then grow into adult insects and emerge when the weather gets warmer. \nOther insects, like ladybugs and praying mantises, go into a state of dormancy during the winter. This means that they stop moving and become very still, almost like they are sleeping. They are able to do this because their bodies are able to slow down their metabolism and use very little energy until the weather gets warm again. \nSo, insects have many different ways of surviving the winter, but they all have to find a way to stay warm, find food, and avoid predators until the weather gets warm again."],"14297":["Obamacare is a nickname for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which is a law that was passed in the United States in 2010. It was intended to make it easier for people to get health insurance, particularly for those who had previously been unable to afford it or who had been denied coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions. The main goal of Obamacare was to increase the number of Americans who had health insurance, and to make it more affordable for those who did have insurance. To achieve this, the law required most Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. It also provided subsidies to help lower-income people afford coverage, and it required insurance companies to offer plans with certain minimum benefits. There have been a lot of debates and controversies surrounding Obamacare, and some people have strongly opposed it. Some people opposed it because they believed it would be too expensive, while others opposed it because they thought it would lead to government interference in the healthcare system. Some people also opposed it because they did not think it went far enough to reform the healthcare system, while others opposed it because they believed it went too far. Ultimately, the law has had a mixed impact, and its long-term effects are still being debated."],"9728":["As you get closer to the center of the Earth, the gravitational pull on you becomes stronger. This is because the mass of the Earth is concentrated more towards the center, so there is more mass pulling you towards it as you get closer.\r\n\r\nImagine you are standing on a scale on the surface of the Earth. The scale measures how much gravity is pulling you down. Now imagine you start digging a tunnel straight down through the Earth. As you get deeper and closer to the center of the Earth, the scale would show that the gravitational pull on you is getting stronger. This is because there is more mass below you, pulling you towards it.\r\n\r\nThe same is true if you were to go up into space. The further you get from the Earth, the weaker the gravitational pull becomes because there is less mass around you to pull you towards it."],"294":["Old or damaged red blood cells are removed from circulation and replaced with new ones. When red blood cells are no longer able to function properly, they are removed from circulation by special cells called macrophages. Macrophages are found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and they are responsible for scavenging and removing old or damaged cells from the body. When a macrophage encounters a red blood cell that is no longer able to function properly, it engulfs the cell and breaks it down into its constituent parts. The macrophage then recycles these parts, using them to create new cells or to perform other important functions in the body. So, when an old red blood cell dies, it is removed from circulation and its parts are recycled by the body to be used again."],"13493":["It's important to call your doctor if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours because this is a condition called priapism, which is a prolonged and often painful erection that is not caused by sexual arousal. If left untreated, priapism can lead to serious problems such as scarring, impotence, and in rare cases, the need for amputation. It's important to seek medical attention as soon as possible if you are experiencing priapism because the longer you wait, the more difficult it can be to treat the condition. Calling another girl would not be a helpful or appropriate way to address this medical issue. Instead, you should call your doctor or go to the emergency room to seek medical treatment. The duration of an erection that warrants medical attention is not necessarily the same for every person and can depend on various factors such as age and underlying health conditions. In general, however, an erection lasting longer than 4 hours is considered a medical emergency and requires immediate attention."],"9799":["Keys and locks work by using a specific pattern or shape that fits together in a certain way. Imagine if you had a puzzle with many different pieces, and each puzzle piece only fits into one specific spot in the puzzle. That's kind of how keys and locks work.\r\n\r\nEvery lock is designed to only open with a certain key that has the same pattern or shape. So if you have a lock with a certain pattern, and you try to use a key with a different pattern, it won't fit and the lock won't open.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of different patterns that locks can use, so there are many different keys that can open different locks.

However, it is unlikely that she actually said these words. The phrase is often used to symbolize the disconnection between the wealthy and privileged elite and the struggles of the common people.During the French Revolution, there was a lot of poverty and hunger among the lower classes in France. The phrase \"let them eat cake\" suggests that Marie Antoinette, who was very wealthy and privileged, was indifferent to the suffering of the poor and had no understanding of their struggles. This phrase was used as an example of the callousness and insensitivity of the monarchy and helped to fuel the anger and resentment of the lower classes, which eventually led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the start of the French Revolution."],"746":["Cancer is a complex disease that can be difficult to treat, even when we know how it starts and how it spreads. There are several reasons why we have not been able to eliminate cancer entirely: \n1. Cancer cells are very good at evading our body's natural defenses. They are able to hide from the immune system and continue to grow and spread. \n2. Cancer cells are also very good at adapting and changing, which makes it difficult for treatments to effectively target and kill them. \n3. Different types of cancer can behave very differently, and what works for one type of cancer may not work for another. This means that researchers and doctors have to come up with different approaches and treatments for each type of cancer. \n4. Early detection and treatment of cancer is important, but it is not always possible to catch cancer in its early stages. Some types of cancer do not have obvious symptoms until they have already advanced, which can make them more difficult to treat. \n5. Finally, cancer research is a very complex and time-consuming process. It takes a lot of effort and resources to develop new treatments and to test them to make sure they are safe and effective. \nOverall, timing of treatment is just one factor that can affect the success of cancer treatment. There are many other factors that contribute to the effectiveness of treatment, including the type and stage of the cancer, the patient's overall health, and the specific treatment being used."],"2440":["In a factory, there are people called engineers who design and build the machines that are used to manufacture products. These machines are typically very complex and are programmed to do specific tasks very accurately and efficiently. For example, an assembly machine might be programmed to pick up parts, move them into place, and then fasten them together using bolts or screws. The machine knows how to do this because it has been programmed with instructions that tell it exactly what to do. Engineers use computer-aided design (CAD) software to create detailed plans for the machines they want to build. They use these plans to create physical models of the machines, which they can test and refine until they are satisfied with the design. Once the machine has been built, it is tested to make sure it is working correctly and can perform all the tasks it was designed to do. So in a \"How It's Made\" episode, the engineers who design and build the machines would be the ones who plan how the machines work and what they do. These machines are an important part of the manufacturing process, as they help to produce high-quality products quickly and efficiently."],"16361":["Sure! Football is a sport played by two teams of eleven players each. The teams try to score points by getting the ball into the other team's end zone, either by running with the ball or throwing it to a teammate.\n\nThe team with the ball tries to move it down the field by running or throwing it. The other team tries to stop them and take control of the ball. If the team with the ball gets tackled (touched to the ground by a member of the other team) or throws an incomplete pass (a pass that is not caught by a teammate), they have to give up the ball and the other team gets a chance to try and score.\n\nThe team that has the ball can also score points by kicking the ball through a set of goalposts. This is called a field goal.\n\nThe team that scores the most points wins the game.\n\nDoes that help?"],"13357":["Methamphetamine, also known as meth, is a highly addictive and dangerous stimulant drug. It can have many negative effects on a person's physical and mental health, including changes to their appearance. One reason that meth users may have \"messed up\" faces is because of the way the drug can affect their skin. Meth can cause a person to develop sores or infections on their skin, as well as acne and other skin problems. These problems can lead to scarring and changes in the appearance of a person's face. Another reason that meth users may have changes in their appearance is because of the way the drug can affect their teeth. Meth can cause a person to grind their teeth, leading to tooth damage and decay. It can also cause a person to have dry mouth, which can lead to gum disease and tooth loss. Finally, meth can cause a person to lose weight and have a gaunt, malnourished appearance, which can also contribute to changes in their facial features. It's important to remember that using drugs like meth can have serious and lasting consequences for a person's health and well-being. If you or someone you know is struggling with drug addiction, it's important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many resources available to help people overcome addiction and get the support they need to live healthy and fulfilling lives."],"257":["The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of Vitamin C is the amount of Vitamin C that is considered sufficient for meeting the nutritional needs of most people. This amount can vary depending on a person's age, gender, and other factors. \nVitamin C tablets are often labeled with the percentage of the RDA that a single tablet contains. So, if your Vitamin C tablets have 1250% of the RDA, it means that a single tablet contains 12.5 times the RDA of Vitamin C. This does seem like a lot, but it's important to remember that the RDA is just a guideline and that different people have different Vitamin C needs. Some people may need more Vitamin C than the RDA, while others may need less. \nIt's also worth noting that it is generally safe to take high doses of Vitamin C, as the body can easily excrete any excess through the urine. However, it is always a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen to make sure it is safe and appropriate for you."],"11266":["Dogs enjoy playing fetch because it's a fun game that allows them to use their natural instincts to hunt and retrieve. When a dog plays fetch, they get to run around, use their sense of smell and sight to find the ball, and use their paws and mouth to pick up the ball and bring it back to you.\r\n\r\nDogs also like to play fetch because it's a way for them to bond with their human companions. When a dog brings the ball back to you, it's a way for them to show you that they love and respect you.\r\n\r\nAs for why your dog never seems to want to let go of the ball, it's probably because they're having so much fun playing with it! Some dogs are just really enthusiastic about playing fetch and will want to keep the ball in their mouth as long as possible.

Inside each cell in our bodies, there are many different genes that contain instructions for making proteins. These proteins do all sorts of important jobs, like helping cells to grow and divide, or helping to fight off infections.Cells need to know which genes to read (also known as transcribe) at any given moment because they don't need to make every protein all the time. For example, a skin cell might not need to make the proteins needed to help a person see, because that's not its job.So how does a cell know which genes to transcribe? The answer is that there are special proteins called transcription factors that help to control which genes are transcribed. These proteins bind to specific parts of the DNA near the genes and help to turn them on or off.Sometimes, transcription factors are turned on or off by signals from other parts of the cell. For example, if a cell is damaged or gets an infection, it might need to turn on genes that help it to repair itself or fight off the infection. In these cases, other proteins called signaling molecules can send a signal to the transcription factors, telling them to turn on the right genes.So to answer your question, transcription factors are like the \"rule makers\" that help a cell to know which genes to read. They're controlled by signals from other parts of the cell, and they help the cell to make the proteins it needs to do its job."],"8709":["Shaving cream is used to make the process of shaving easier and more comfortable.

Because of this, it is not uncommon for players to get injured during a soccer match. There are a few reasons why there may seem to be more injuries in soccer compared to other sports like American football. One reason is that soccer players are on the field for a longer period of time compared to American football players. In soccer, the game is continuous for the entire 90 minutes, whereas in American football, there are breaks between plays and the game is divided into four quarters. Another reason is that soccer players may be more prone to certain types of injuries due to the nature of the sport. For example, players may be more likely to suffer from muscle strains or sprains because of the constant running and changing of direction. They may also be more prone to foot and ankle injuries because of the frequent kicking of the ball. It's also worth noting that soccer players may be more prone to getting injured during international tournaments like the World Cup, where the level of competition is higher and the stakes are higher. This may lead to players pushing themselves harder and taking more risks on the field, which can increase the risk of injury. Overall, soccer is a physically demanding sport that can lead to injuries, but it is also an exciting and enjoyable sport that is loved by millions of people around the world."],"6683":["The alphabet we use today has 26 letters because it comes from the ancient Romans, who used the Latin alphabet. The Romans had only 23 letters in their alphabet, but they eventually added three more letters to represent sounds that didn't exist in Latin: J, U, and W.Our alphabet covers most of the sounds that we use in the English language, but it's not perfect. There are a few sounds that we make that don't have a letter all to themselves. For example, the \"th\" sound in the word \"think\" is made by two letters, T and H.It is possible to \"create\" new letters, but it's not easy. The alphabet is a system that we use to write words, and if we add new letters, it can be confusing for people who are used to the old way of writing.

When you wash colored clothes with whites, there is a risk that the dye from the colored clothes will rub off onto the white clothes, which can ruin them. By separating your laundry into colors and whites, you can prevent this from happening and keep your clothes looking their best.\r\n\r\nImagine if you had a white shirt and a red shirt that you washed together. The red dye from the red shirt might rub off onto the white shirt, turning it pink or red. This can be especially frustrating if you really liked that white shirt and now it's not white anymore. By separating the whites from the colors, you can make sure that the white shirt stays white and the red shirt stays red.\r\n\r\nIn general, it's a good idea to sort your laundry into piles based on the color of the clothes.

They are usually found in places that are far away from the ocean, like in the middle of a big land mass. The ocean is a place that has a lot of water, and it can give off a lot of moisture in the air, which can cause it to rain. When you have a desert next to the ocean, it is usually because the air that blows from the ocean towards the desert has already lost most of its moisture, so it doesn't have enough water to make it rain in the desert. The desert is also usually surrounded by mountains, which can block the moist air from the ocean and keep it from reaching the desert. This is why you don't see much rain or vegetation in the desert areas near the ocean."],"875":["Countries like North Korea may obtain war supplies like missiles, nuclear weapons, guns, and planes from a variety of sources. Some of these supplies may be produced domestically, while others may be purchased from other countries or from international arms dealers.

It's not necessarily a natural thing, but it's something that can be learned or developed over time. It's possible that people fear darkness because they associate it with danger or uncertainty. For example, if someone has had a negative experience in the dark, like tripping and falling, they might start to fear the dark because they associate it with being hurt or injured.\r\n\r\nAnother reason people might fear darkness is because they can't see what's around them as well. When it's dark, it's harder to see things, and this can make people feel vulnerable or unsafe.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that people fear darkness because they have an active imagination and they start to imagine things that might be lurking in the shadows. This can be especially true for children, who might not have as much experience with the dark and may not understand that it's perfectly normal and safe.\r\n\r\nOverall, fear of darkness is a natural response that can be caused by a variety of factors, including past experiences, uncertainty, and an active imagination."],"1794":["SQL injection is a type of attack that allows an attacker to insert malicious code into a database through a website's input fields. The attacker can do this by entering specially crafted input into a form or URL on the website. Here's an example of how this works: Imagine you have a website with a login form that asks for a username and password. When a user tries to log in, the website sends a request to a database to check if the provided username and password are correct. The database then sends back a response to the website indicating whether the login was successful or not. Now, suppose an attacker wants to try to log in to the website without knowing the correct username and password. They might try to enter the following into the username field: ' OR 1=1 --, This input is designed to trick the database into thinking that the attacker is trying to enter a username that is just a single quote character, followed by the OR operator, and then the number 1 equals the number 1. The OR operator tells the database to check if either of the conditions on either side of it are true. In this case, the condition on the right (1=1) is always true, so the database will always treat this as a valid login. The -- at the end is used to comment out the rest of the SQL statement, so the database ignores everything after it. This allows the attacker to bypass the login form and potentially access the website without knowing the correct username and password. To test a website for vulnerability to SQL injection attacks, you can try entering similar input into various forms and URLs on the website and see if you are able to access areas of the site that you should not be able to access. It is important to note that attempting to hack a website without permission is illegal and can result in serious consequences."],"15552":["Communism is a political and economic ideology that aims to create a society in which everyone works together for the common good and the means of production, such as factories and farms, are owned and controlled by the community as a whole rather than by individual people or businesses. The idea behind communism is to create a more equal society where everyone has the same opportunities and resources, and no one is exploited or oppressed.\n\nHowever, there have been several problems with the implementation of communism in practice. One problem is that it can be difficult to determine how to fairly distribute resources and wealth among everyone in the community. In some communist countries, the government has tried to solve this problem by setting prices for goods and services and controlling how much of each product can be produced, but this can lead to shortages of certain goods and a lack of incentives for people to work hard and produce more.\n\nAnother problem with communism is that it often requires a strong and centralized government to oversee the distribution of resources and make decisions about how the economy should be run. This can lead to a lack of individual freedom and a lack of democracy, as the government has a lot of control over people's lives.\n\nIn Russia, communism was adopted after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, and the country became known as the Soviet Union. The Soviet government implemented a number of policies that aimed to create a more equal society, such as land reform, education, and healthcare programs. However, the Soviet government also had a lot of control over people's lives and suppressed political opposition. This led to widespread human rights abuses, including the imprisonment and execution of political dissidents. In addition, the Soviet Union's economy struggled to meet the needs of its people, leading to shortages of food and other basic necessities.\n\nOverall, while the idea behind communism may have been to create a more equal and fair society, the implementation of communism in practice has often been problematic and has led to a number of negative consequences."],"7500":["200 mg tablets are not 200 times bigger than 1 mg tablets because the size of a tablet has more to do with how much of the active ingredient, or medicine, it contains, rather than the total weight of the tablet. To make a 200 mg tablet, the manufacturer would need to add enough inactive ingredients, such as binders, fillers, and coatings, to the active ingredient to make a tablet that weighs 200 mg in total. These inactive ingredients help hold the tablet together and give it its shape, but they do not have any medicinal value.To compress all of the miligrams into a small tablet, the manufacturer may use a machine called a tablet press. This machine uses high pressure to compress the mixture of active and inactive ingredients into a small, hard tablet. The pressure and heat used during this process can also help to bind the ingredients together, making the tablet more durable and easy to swallow.So, to sum it up, the size of a tablet does not necessarily have to do with the amount of medicine it contains. Instead, the size is determined by the amount of inactive ingredients needed to hold the active ingredient together in the correct dosage."],"2187":["Sure! I'll do my best to explain this in a way that is easy to understand. First, it's important to understand that the economy is a complex system that involves many different people and organizations. One of these organizations is Wall Street, which is a financial district in New York City that is home to many banks, investment firms, and other financial institutions. The economy can be affected by many different factors, including the actions of these financial institutions. One way that Wall Street and the bankers can potentially mess up the economy is by making risky financial decisions that lead to financial crises or economic downturns. For example, in the late 2000s, many banks and other financial institutions made risky investments in housing, which led to a housing market crash and a financial crisis known as the Great Recession. Another way that Wall Street and the bankers can potentially affect the economy is by using their influence and power to shape economic policy and regulations in ways that benefit their own interests, rather than the interests of the general public. This can lead to economic inequality and financial instability. It's also important to note that the economy is a global system, and events and decisions in other countries can also have an impact on the economy in the United States.

An engine is a machine that converts energy into motion. It does this by burning fuel, which is a type of energy stored in a chemical form.\n\nWhen you put fuel into an engine, it goes into a special part called the fuel tank. From there, it is pumped into the engine through a tube called a fuel line.\n\nInside the engine, there is a small explosion that happens when the fuel is mixed with air and a spark is introduced. This explosion pushes a metal rod called a piston, which moves back and forth inside a cylinder. The movement of the piston turns a shaft, which is connected to the wheels of a car or other vehicle.\n\nSo, the fuel is required to make the engine run because it provides the energy for the small explosion that moves the piston and turns the shaft. The engine needs a continuous supply of fuel to keep running.\n\nI hope that helps to explain how fuel makes an engine run!

The attack led to the United States entering World War II. There were several reasons why the Japanese decided to attack Pearl Harbor. One reason was that Japan was seeking to expand its empire and saw the United States as a potential obstacle to its ambitions. Japan also wanted to secure access to the natural resources of Southeast Asia, and believed that by attacking the United States, it could deter the United States from interfering with its plans. Another reason for the attack was that the United States had imposed economic sanctions on Japan in response to Japan's aggressive actions in China and Southeast Asia. These sanctions, which included a ban on the export of oil and other vital resources to Japan, were hurting Japan's economy and military capabilities. The Japanese government believed that by attacking the United States, it could force the United States to lift these sanctions and give Japan the resources it needed to continue its military expansion. In short, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was a strategic move motivated by a desire for empire and resources, and was also a response to the economic pressure being exerted on Japan by the United States."],"12463":["There is no particular reason why television show hosts always sit on the right while guests sit on the left.

Each lock has its own unique key, called a \"change key,\" that is used to open that specific lock. The master key, on the other hand, can open all of the locks that are designed to work with it. To understand how this works, it's helpful to think about how a lock and key work. When you insert a key into a lock, the teeth on the key match up with the pins inside the lock. The pins are held in place by a spring, and when the key is turned, it pushes the pins up to a certain level. If the pins are all at the right height, the lock will open. To make a master key, the locksmith creates a special key that has extra teeth on it. These extra teeth match up with the pins in the lock in a way that allows the master key to open the lock, even if the change key doesn't.

This means that the images on the film or video are turned into a series of digital numbers that a computer can understand and manipulate.\r\n\r\nOnce the footage is digitized, the image can be enhanced and cleaned up using a variety of techniques. For example, the color and contrast of the image can be adjusted to make it look more vibrant and lifelike. Any scratches, dust, or other imperfections on the original film or video can also be removed digitally.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it may be possible to extract more detail from the original footage by using special software that can \"interpolate\" new pixels based on the existing ones. This can help to make the image appear sharper and clearer, but it can also introduce some artificial-looking artifacts if not done carefully.\r\n\r\nOverall, the process of creating a high definition version of an old TV show or movie involves a combination of digital restoration and enhancement techniques, all designed to improve the look and quality of the original footage as much as possible."],"7895":["Recipes from the medieval period and earlier were often written in a very general way because people back then didn't have the same tools and techniques that we have today. They didn't have measuring cups or spoons, so they couldn't give precise measurements like we do in modern recipes. They also didn't have ovens or stoves like we have today, so they had to cook food over a fire or in a pot. This means that the cooking time and temperature for a recipe might vary depending on how hot the fire was or how close the pot was to the fire. Because of all these differences, it was necessary for the people who wrote these old recipes to be very general and vague in their instructions. However, the people who used these recipes were usually experienced cooks who knew how to adjust the ingredients and cooking times based on their own knowledge and experience."],"5998":["The Earth spins on its axis very fast, but because the Earth is so big, it takes a long time for the spin to cause any noticeable effects. It's like if you are on a carousel (a roundabout) at the fair. Even though the carousel is spinning very fast, you don't feel like you are moving very fast because you are moving with the carousel. It's only when you try to walk around the outside of the carousel that you feel like you are moving faster because you are not moving with the spin of the carousel. The same is true for the Earth. We are moving with the Earth's spin, so we don't feel like we are moving very fast."],"3422":["It's important to note that the Cleveland kidnapper, Ariel Castro, was only charged with 977 counts in relation to the kidnapping and abuse of three women: Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus, and Michelle Knight. These three women were held captive in Castro's home for several years and were subjected to physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. The large number of charges that Castro faced reflects the severity and duration of the crimes that he committed against these three women. Each count likely represents a specific instance of abuse or a violation of the law. For example, there may have been charges for kidnapping, rape, assault, and unlawful imprisonment, among others. It's also worth noting that some of the charges may have been for offenses that took place over a period of time, rather than for a single incident. For example, if Castro was charged with a count of kidnapping for each day that the women were held captive, that could contribute to the large number of charges. I hope this helps to clarify the situation. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask."],"11084":["When you crack your knuckles or joints, you are stretching and pulling on the bones and the connective tissue around them. This can cause the joint to make a cracking or popping sound. It is not fully understood why this happens or what the long-term effects of cracking your joints might be. Some people believe that cracking your joints can cause problems like arthritis or other joint complications, but there is no scientific evidence to support this. Cracking your joints may feel good in the moment, but it is generally not recommended because it can cause your joint to become less stable over time. It is a good idea to be gentle with your joints and avoid activities that might cause them to become damaged."],"10695":["It's not accurate to say that liberals are generally despised in American politics. While some people may disagree with liberal policies or political views, it's important to remember that there are many people who support and advocate for liberal policies, and they should not be disrespected or treated unfairly because of their beliefs.\r\n\r\nOne reason that some people may view liberals negatively is because they disagree with the policies that liberals support. For example, some people may believe that healthcare should be provided by private insurance companies rather than the government, and they may view efforts to reform the healthcare system in a more liberal direction as misguided or even harmful. Similarly, some people may believe that individuals have the right to own and use firearms without any restrictions, and they may view efforts to regulate gun ownership as an infringement on their rights.\r\n\r\nIt's also important to note that political labels like \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" can mean different things to different people, and people may use these labels to try to simplify complex issues or to demonize those who hold opposing views. In a political climate that can be highly divisive, it's important to try to understand and respect the viewpoints of others, even if we disagree with them."],"3057":["The observer effect in quantum physics refers to the idea that the act of observing or measuring a quantum system can affect its behavior. In other words, the mere presence of an observer can change the outcome of an experiment involving a quantum system. To understand the observer effect, it's helpful to first understand some basic principles of quantum physics. In quantum physics, particles like atoms and subatomic particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This means that they can sometimes behave like waves, spreading out and interfering with each other, and at other times behave like discrete particles with definite positions and properties. One of the strange and counterintuitive aspects of quantum physics is the principle of superposition, which states that a quantum system can exist in multiple states or configurations at the same time. For example, an electron can simultaneously exist in multiple energy levels or locations. However, when we try to observe or measure the state of a quantum system, it seems to \"collapse\" into a single state. This is where the observer effect comes in. The act of observing or measuring the state of a quantum system can cause its wave function (a mathematical description of the system's state) to collapse, causing it to behave like a particle with a definite position and properties. In other words, the act of observation affects the outcome of the experiment by causing the system to settle into a particular state. So, to explain the observer effect to a five-year-old, you might say that when we look at something really small, like an atom or an electron, it can be in lots of different places or states at the same time. But when we look at it, it has to choose one place or state to be in, and that's what we see. The act of looking at it changes what it does. Does that make sense?"],"15122":["Sure! Airplanes fly by using lift, which is a force that pushes the airplane up into the air. Lift is created when air flows over and under the wings of the airplane. The shape of the wings is carefully designed to create lift and keep the airplane in the air.\n\nAirplanes fly at high altitudes for a few reasons. First, the air at high altitudes is much thinner, so there is less resistance, or drag, which makes it easier for the airplane to fly. Second, flying at high altitudes also allows airplanes to avoid bad weather, such as clouds and thunderstorms, which can make flying difficult and dangerous. Finally, flying at high altitudes can also help airplanes save fuel because the thin air requires less power to fly through.\n\nWhile it might seem like it would be shorter to fly closer to the surface of the earth, there are a few reasons why this is not always the case. First, flying closer to the ground can be more difficult because there is more drag, or resistance, from the air. Second, flying lower can also increase the risk of running into obstacles, such as mountains and tall buildings. Finally, flying at high altitudes allows airplanes to take advantage of strong, steady winds that can help them travel faster and more efficiently."],"2540":["The Joker card is a special card found in some card decks, including standard playing cards and tarot cards. It is usually portrayed as a court jester or a fool, and is often depicted with a comical or mischievous expression. The Joker card originated in the United States in the late 1800s and was originally used as a wild card in certain card games. It could be used to represent any other card in the deck, which made it very useful and valuable in certain situations. Nowadays, the Joker card is still used as a wild card in some card games, but it is also used for other purposes, such as in card tricks and magic tricks. Some people also use the Joker card as a way to keep track of the score in card games or to represent certain actions or rules in certain games. In short, the Joker card is a special card that is used in a variety of card games and can have different purposes depending on the game or activity."],"4783":["Sure! When you put on ski goggles, they help protect your eyes from the bright light and glare that can come off the snow. They do this by using special lenses that block out certain wavelengths of light. Different ski goggles can have different types of lenses, and some may block out more or less light in different wavelengths.\\n\\nWhen you take off the ski goggles, your eyes have been exposed to a different range of light wavelengths than they are used to. As a result, your brain has to adjust to the new wavelengths it is seeing. This can cause your perception of color to be different for a little while until your brain adjusts to the new light conditions.\\n\\nThink of it like when you put on a pair of glasses with a different prescription than you are used to. It takes your eyes a little while to get used to seeing things through the new glasses, and everything might look a little strange or distorted at first. The same thing can happen when you take off ski goggles, except that it's your brain that needs to adjust, not just your eyes."],"15044":["Hard drives store information on spinning disks called platters.

For example, banks need space for teller stations where customers can conduct transactions, such as depositing or withdrawing money. They also need space for offices where bank employees can work and meet with customers to discuss financial products and services. In addition, banks often have conference rooms and training rooms for meetings and training sessions, as well as areas for storing important documents and equipment.\\n\\nBanks also need space for their computer systems and other technology, which are used to process transactions and manage the bank's records.

In fact, recent research has shown that the gender divide in video game players is not as wide as it may seem, and that both men and women enjoy playing video games.There are a few reasons why the stereotype that video games are primarily for men has persisted. One reason is that in the past, many video games were marketed primarily to men and boys, and this may have contributed to the idea that video games are for men. Additionally, the video game industry has traditionally been male-dominated, both in terms of the developers who create the games and the characters and storylines that are often featured in them.However, it's important to remember that video games are enjoyed by people of all genders and ages, and that there are a wide variety of games available to suit different interests and preferences. So while it's true that some people may perceive video games as being more appealing to men, it's important to remember that everyone can enjoy playing video games."],"16868":["Torrenting is a way to download and share files over the internet. When you download a file using a torrent client, you are downloading small pieces of the file from many different sources, rather than downloading the entire file from a single source.

This is called \"seeding.\" When you seed a file, your IP address is visible to other people who are downloading the file.\n\nCopyright holders and law enforcement agencies can monitor torrent swarms and collect the IP addresses of people who are seeding or downloading copyrighted material. They can then send a notice to the internet service provider (ISP) associated with that IP address, asking them to identify the owner of the IP address. If the owner of the IP address is found to be downloading or sharing copyrighted material without permission, they may be fined or sued.\n\nSo, to answer your question, people can get caught torrenting games, movies, or music by uploading (seeding) the torrent file, and having their IP address identified by copyright holders or law enforcement agencies."],"5147":["\\nIn video games, \"meta\" refers to the dominant strategies or techniques that are widely used in competitive play. These strategies can emerge and evolve over time as players discover and refine the most effective ways to play the game.\\n\\nIn some cases, the developers of a game may intentionally design certain elements of the game to encourage certain playstyles or strategies. For example, they may balance the abilities of different characters in a way that makes certain combinations of characters more powerful than others.\\n\\nHowever, the meta can also evolve organically as players experiment with different strategies and share their experiences with others. This can happen in any competitive game, whether it's a fighting game like Street Fighter or a team-based shooter like Overwatch.\\n\\nUltimately, the meta in a game is shaped by the players who are competing in it. They are the ones who are constantly trying out new strategies and looking for ways to gain an advantage over their opponents. As a result, the meta in a game can change quite quickly as players discover and popularize new strategies, and developers may need to make adjustments to keep the game balanced and fair."],"5410":["\\nCurly hair is caused by the shape of the hair follicle, which is the small tube-like structure in the skin that grows a single strand of hair. The shape of the hair follicle determines the shape of the hair strand, and people with curly hair have hair follicles that are shaped like a flat oval or a twisted spiral.\\n\\nThe genes that you inherit from your parents play a big role in determining the shape of your hair follicles and, therefore, the type of hair you have. If you have curly hair, it is likely that one or both of your parents passed down the genes for curly hair to you. However, it is also possible to have curly hair even if neither of your parents have it, because you may have inherited different genes from each parent.\\n\\nIn addition to the shape of the hair follicle, the physical structure of the hair strand itself also plays a role in determining whether hair is curly or not. Hair is made up of a protein called keratin, and the keratin in curly hair is shaped differently than the keratin in straight hair. The keratin in curly hair is more irregular and has a more twisted or coiled shape, which causes the hair to curl as it grows.\\n\\nOverall, curly hair is caused by the shape of the hair follicle and the structure of the hair strand, and these characteristics are determined by the genes that you inherit from your parents.\\n"],"9305":["An honorary degree is a type of academic degree that is given to someone as an honor or recognition of their achievements or contributions in a particular field, but without the recipient having to complete the usual coursework or exams that are required for a regular degree.

For example, some people may not have the money to pay for a passport or birth certificate, or they may live in an area where it is difficult to get to a place where they can obtain these documents. As a result, these individuals may be prevented from voting, even though they are legally entitled to do so.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that voter ID laws are not always racist in and of themselves. However, the way that they are implemented and enforced can sometimes disproportionately impact certain groups of people, which can create the perception that they are being used to suppress the votes of certain groups. This can be especially true if the laws are implemented in a way that makes it harder for certain groups of people to vote, such as by closing polling stations in areas with high concentrations of minority voters or by making it difficult for people to get the identification they need."],"5311":["\\nWhen you hear your own voice in a video, it might sound different to you because the sound waves that you hear when you talk are different from the ones that you hear when you listen to a recording of your voice.\\n\\nWhen you speak, the sound waves created by your voice travel through the air and into your own ears.

However, it can also be expensive and energy-intensive. In California, where there is a shortage of water, desalination is one of several options that have been considered to help meet the state's water needs. One reason why California has not fully embraced desalination is that it can be expensive to build and operate desalination plants. These plants require a lot of energy to run, which can drive up the cost of producing desalinated water. Additionally, the process of desalination generates a lot of waste in the form of salty brine, which must be disposed of in an environmentally safe way. Another reason why desalination has not been more widely adopted in California is that there are other options for increasing the state's water supply. For example, California has invested in water conservation measures, such as replacing old, water-inefficient appliances and promoting water-efficient landscaping. The state has also developed infrastructure projects, such as building new reservoirs and pipelines, to help transport water from one part of the state to another. In summary, while desalination can be an effective way to increase the availability of clean water, it can also be expensive and energy-intensive. In California, there are other options for increasing the state's water supply that have been considered before turning to desalination."],"455":["In a vacuum, objects fall at the same speed regardless of their mass because there is no air resistance to slow them down. This is known as the principle of universal gravitation. \nImagine you are standing on a tall building and you drop a feather and a coin at the same time. Without air resistance, the feather and the coin will fall to the ground at the same speed. This is because the only force acting on them is the force of gravity, which is pulling them towards the ground. The mass of the feather and the coin does not affect how fast they fall, only the force of gravity does. \nNow, if you were to drop the feather and the coin in air (not in a vacuum), the feather would fall more slowly than the coin because the air would create a resistance force that slows the feather down. The coin, being more dense and heavier, would not be slowed down as much by the air and would therefore fall faster than the feather. \nI hope this helps!

When you chew mint gum or eat a mint, the menthol in the mint activates temperature-sensitive receptors in your mouth, which can make you feel like the water is colder than it actually is.\n\nIt's important to note that the water itself isn't actually getting colder when you eat mint. The menthol in the mint is simply tricking your brain into thinking that the water is colder than it really is. It's a similar effect to how eating spicy food can make you feel like your mouth is on fire, even though the food itself isn't hot.\n\nSo, in short, mint doesn't actually make water colder, but it can make you feel like it is because of the menthol's cooling effect on your mouth."],"5822":["It's possible that the Ultimate Cleaning BBQ Tool from Costco may not be as effective at cleaning your BBQ as a wire brush.

This is because vaccines not only protect the person who gets the vaccine, but also the people around them. When enough people in a community are vaccinated against a disease, it becomes very difficult for the disease to spread. This is called herd immunity. If we stop vaccinating, the disease can start spreading again, and people who are not protected by the vaccine (like young babies or people with weakened immune systems) could get very sick.\\n\\nSecond, diseases like polio can still be found in other parts of the world. If we stop vaccinating and the disease comes back, it could be brought into our country by travelers. This could lead to outbreaks of the disease in our own community.\\n\\nFinally, some diseases, like polio, have no cure. If someone gets the disease and doesn't die, they may have long-term health problems, like paralysis.

If you stand with your arms stretched out to your sides, the left arm is usually weaker than the right arm. This is because most people are right-handed and use their right arm more often than their left arm, so the right arm is stronger. In a race, if everyone is running in the same direction, the person on the inside of the curve will have to run a shorter distance than the person on the outside of the curve. If the race were run clockwise, the person on the inside of the curve would have to use their weaker left arm to navigate the curve, while the person on the outside of the curve would have to use their stronger right arm. This would give the person on the inside of the curve an unfair advantage. Therefore, it is more fair to run the race in the opposite direction, so that everyone has to use their weaker arm to navigate the curve.

The No-Communication Theorem is a principle in physics that states that it is not possible to use quantum entanglement, or any other physical process, to send a message or communicate information faster than the speed of light. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more particles become \"linked\" or connected in a way that allows them to affect each other's behavior even when separated by large distances. This strange behavior has led some people to wonder if it could be used to send messages faster than the speed of light, which would violate the laws of physics. However, the No-Communication Theorem states that this is not possible. In order to send a message or communicate information, you need to be able to control the state of one of the entangled particles in some way, and then measure the state of the other particle to see how it has changed. But according to the No-Communication Theorem, it is not possible to control the state of a particle in such a way that it would allow you to send a message faster than the speed of light. So, while quantum entanglement is an interesting and strange phenomenon, it cannot be used to send messages or communicate information faster than the speed of light."],"12971":["During the Holocaust, the Nazis used a number of methods to distinguish Jews from non-Jews. They used physical characteristics, such as eye color, hair color, and facial features, to determine who was Jewish. They also relied on religious identification, such as membership in a synagogue or possession of Jewish religious texts. The Nazis also used birth certificates and other official documents to determine a person's ancestry. If a person faked their birth certificate to show that they were not Jewish, it is possible that they could have fooled the Nazis into ignoring them. However, this would have been very risky, as the Nazis were very thorough in their efforts to identify and persecute Jews. If a person was caught with a fake birth certificate or other false documents, they could have faced severe consequences, including imprisonment or death.

They are extremely hard to detect because they do not emit any light or other types of electromagnetic radiation, which makes them difficult to see directly. However, scientists have been able to infer the existence of black holes by observing their effects on other objects. For example, if a black hole is located near a star, it can pull the star towards it and cause it to move in strange and unusual ways. Scientists can observe these movements and use them to deduce the presence of a black hole. Additionally, scientists can use telescopes and other instruments to detect the radiation emitted by material falling into a black hole. This is known as an \"accretion disk,\" and it can give off a lot of radiation as the material falls into the black hole and gets very hot. Overall, scientists use a combination of indirect observations and mathematical models to study black holes and understand more about their properties. While it was not possible to capture an image of a black hole until very recently, scientists have been able to learn a great deal about these mysterious and fascinating objects by studying their effects on the objects around them."],"5112":["\\nSatellite phones have been around for a long time, and they do offer near universal coverage, but they have not become the norm for a number of reasons. Here are a few:\\n\\nCost: Satellite phones are generally more expensive than other types of phones, and they often require a separate contract or service plan. This can make them less appealing to people who are looking for a more affordable communication option.\\n\\nSize: Satellite phones are generally larger and bulkier than other types of phones, which can be inconvenient for people who are looking for a more portable option.\\n\\nDependence on satellites: Satellite phones rely on satellites in order to function, and this can sometimes lead to delays or disruptions in service. This can be frustrating for people who are used to the reliability of other types of phone service.\\n\\nOverall, while satellite phones do offer near universal coverage, they have not become the norm because they are generally more expensive, larger, and less reliable than other types of phones.\\n"],"9328":["Policing is a complex and often difficult job, and unfortunately, there have been instances where police officers have done things that are wrong or inappropriate. In some cases, these actions may be illegal and the officers may be punished through the criminal justice system. However, in other cases, the actions of the officers may not be illegal but still may be considered wrong or inappropriate.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, it can be difficult for the officers to be punished because of the protections that are in place for them as part of their employment. For example, police officers may have certain rights and privileges when it comes to discipline and firing, and it can be difficult for their superiors or the government to take action against them. Additionally, there may be other factors at play, such as political considerations or pressure from police unions, that can make it harder for officers to be held accountable for their actions.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that the vast majority of police officers are good people who are trying to do their best to keep their communities safe. However, when officers do wrong, it is important that they be held accountable and that steps be taken to ensure that similar incidents do not happen in the future."],"8812":["The National Security Agency (NSA) is a government agency responsible for collecting and analyzing communication and other electronic data for the purpose of national security. While it is important for the government to have the ability to gather information in order to protect the country and its citizens, there are concerns about the privacy of individuals when the government collects and stores their personal information.\r\n\r\nHere are a few reasons why NSA spying on you might be a bad thing:\r\n\r\nInvasion of privacy: When the NSA collects and stores your personal information, it is essentially invading your privacy. This can feel like a violation of your personal space and autonomy.\r\n\r\nLack of transparency: The NSA's activities are often shrouded in secrecy, which can make it difficult for individuals to understand exactly what the agency is doing and how it is using their personal information.\r\n\r\nPotential for abuse: While the NSA is supposed to use its powers only for national security purposes, there have been instances in the past where government agencies have abused their powers and used them for other purposes. This can erode trust in the government and create a sense of fear and mistrust among the general population.\r\n\r\nLegal issues: There are also legal issues surrounding the NSA's activities, including questions about the extent to which the agency is allowed to collect and use personal information. Some people believe that the NSA's activities may be unconstitutional, as they may infringe on the privacy rights of individuals.\r\n\r\nIn summary, NSA spying on you can be a bad thing because it can invade your privacy, be secretive, have the potential for abuse, and raise legal issues."],"3112":["Homosexuality exists because it is a natural variation that occurs in human sexuality.

For example, the processor and memory may not be able to keep up with newer, more demanding software, which can cause the laptop to slow down.\r\n\r\nFinally, laptops can slow down if they get too hot. When laptops are used for a long time, they can generate a lot of heat, which can cause the components inside to slow down in order to prevent overheating. This can also cause the laptop to run more slowly.\r\n\r\nOverall, there are a lot of factors that can contribute to a laptop slowing down over time. However, there are things you can do to help keep your laptop running smoothly, such as keeping it clean and well-maintained, and making sure you have enough storage space and memory."],"16096":["Sure! The Theory of Evolution is a scientific explanation for how living things change over time. It explains that living things have evolved, or changed, over millions of years through a process called natural selection.\n\nHere's how it works: Every living thing has certain traits, or characteristics, that help it survive and reproduce. For example, a bird might have strong wings that allow it to fly, or a plant might have a deep root system that helps it get water from the ground. These traits are passed down from parent to offspring through genes, which are like little codes that tell our bodies how to grow and function.\n\nSometimes, changes happen in the genes by accident, called mutations. These mutations can cause an animal or plant to have a new trait that might help it survive better in its environment. For example, a bird might be born with longer wings than its parents, which might make it easier for it to fly and catch food.\n\nIf this new trait helps the bird survive and have babies, those babies are more likely to have the same trait, because they got the gene for it from their parent. Over time, more and more members of the species will have this trait, because the ones with the trait are more likely to survive and reproduce.\n\nThis process, where traits that help a living thing survive and reproduce become more common in a population over time, is called natural selection. It's a slow process that happens over many generations, but it can lead to big changes in a species.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any questions about how it works?"],"3687":["It's not really fair to say that generation X (which refers to people born between the mid-1960s and the early 1980s) has \"dropped the ball\" or is a generation of \"screw ups.\" Every generation has its own challenges and successes, and it's important to remember that every individual is different and has their own unique experiences and accomplishments. It's possible that some people may have negative views of generation X because of societal or economic issues that were happening during that time period, or because of stereotypes or biases that exist about certain age groups. However, it's important to remember that every generation has its own unique strengths and contributions, and it's not fair to make broad generalizations about an entire group of people based on their age."],"15855":["This content may violate our content policy.

There are many variables that can affect the price of a stock, and it is often hard to predict with any certainty how the market will perform in the short term. As a result, many investors who try to time the market end up losing money, rather than gaining wealth.One reason why more investors may lose money in the stock market is because it can be volatile, which means that prices can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. This can make it hard for investors to make informed decisions about when to buy and sell stocks, and they may end up making mistakes that result in losses.Another reason is that the stock market can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, company news, and global events. These factors can change rapidly and can be difficult to predict, making it challenging for investors to make informed decisions about the market.Finally, some investors may try to time the market by trying to follow the latest trends or hot tips, rather than doing their own research and making informed decisions based on solid analysis. This can be a risky strategy, as it is often hard to predict which trends will continue and which will not.Overall, timing the stock market is a difficult and risky strategy that is not suitable for most investors. It is generally better to develop a long-term investment plan and to stay focused on your goals, rather than trying to chase short-term gains in the market."],"6590":["The suits depicted in Interstellar and The Martian are not based on any real-life suits that have been used for space exploration.

Let's break this down. The story you're referring to is a story that many people believe to be true, and it is found in the Bible, which is a book that is very important to many people who follow the religion of Christianity.\\n\\nAccording to this story, Jesus was a man who lived a long time ago, and he was believed by many people to be the son of God. Jesus was killed by being crucified on a cross, and this happened on a Friday, which is why it is sometimes called \"Good Friday.\"\\n\\nAfter Jesus died, his body was placed in a tomb, which is a type of large stone container that was used in ancient times to bury the bodies of dead people. Jesus' body was placed in the tomb and a big stone was rolled in front of the entrance to the tomb to keep anyone from getting in.\\n\\nThree days later, on a Sunday, the story says that Jesus came back to life and left the tomb.

These resources can include a larger team of attorneys and staff, a wider network of professional contacts, and access to specialized knowledge and technology. In addition, high-profile law firms may have a reputation for being successful, which can make them more appealing to potential clients and give them an advantage in negotiations with opposing counsel. Lower-paid attorneys may not have the same level of resources or experience, but they can still be skilled and effective at what they do. The main difference between highly-paid attorneys and lower-paid attorneys is often the amount of money they charge for their services.

However, many people still choose to eat meat because they enjoy the taste and it is a cultural tradition for some.\n\nWearing fur, on the other hand, is often considered less moral because it involves causing harm to animals. To obtain fur, animals such as foxes, minks, and rabbits are often raised on fur farms, where they are kept in small, confined spaces and may not have the opportunity to engage in their natural behaviors. They are also often killed in ways that may be considered inhumane. In contrast, many people who eat meat may try to make choices that are more humane, such as choosing meat from animals that were raised in a more natural environment and treated well.\n\nOverall, the moral considerations of wearing fur and eating meat may depend on personal values and beliefs about the treatment of animals. Some people may believe that it is wrong to cause harm to animals for any reason, while others may feel that it is acceptable as long as the animals are treated well and the meat or fur is used in a respectful way."],"6291":["Whiskey companies like Makers Mark are able to produce a large quantity of whiskey while still aging it for 10+ years by using a combination of techniques.One technique is to use large barrels for aging the whiskey. Whiskey is aged in barrels made of oak, which imparts flavors and aromas to the whiskey as it matures. By using larger barrels, the whiskey company can age more whiskey at once, which helps them keep up with demand for their product.Another technique is to use a process called \"solera aging.\" This involves blending together whiskey from barrels of different ages, so that the final product has an average age that is older than any single barrel used in the blend. For example, a whiskey company might blend together whiskey that is 5 years old, 7 years old, and 10 years old, to create a final product that is 8 years old. This allows the company to create a consistent product without having to wait for all of the whiskey to reach the same age.Finally, whiskey companies may also use a technique called \"accelerated aging,\" which involves artificially aging the whiskey by exposing it to high temperatures and humidity levels. This can help the whiskey mature more quickly, allowing the company to produce a large quantity of aged whiskey in a shorter period of time. However, this technique is controversial because some people believe it does not produce the same high-quality flavors and aromas as traditional aging methods."],"9241":["Power plants generate electricity, but they don't store it in the same way that you might store food in a fridge or toys in a toy box. Instead, power plants send the electricity they generate through power lines to homes and businesses that need it.\r\n\r\nPower plants are usually designed to generate a certain amount of electricity, and they try to generate that electricity at a consistent rate. However, the demand for electricity can vary a lot over the course of a day, so power plants have to be able to adjust how much electricity they are generating.\r\n\r\nTo help with this, power plants often have devices called \"regulators\" that can increase or decrease the amount of electricity being generated. This helps to make sure that the power plant is able to meet the changing demand for electricity.\r\n\r\nPower plants also have backup systems that can generate electricity if there is a problem with the main power-generating equipment. These backup systems might be diesel generators or batteries that can provide electricity for a short period of time until the main power-generating equipment can be repaired or restarted.\r\n\r\nOverall, power plants are designed to generate electricity as efficiently as possible and send it to where it is needed, rather than storing it for later use."],"9358":["Air pollution is a problem that has been around for a long time, and it is caused by many different things.

I'd be happy to help explain the difference between hedge funds, mutual funds, and other types of investment funds. First, let's start with mutual funds. A mutual fund is a type of investment vehicle that pools together money from many different investors and uses that money to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. The goal of a mutual fund is to provide investors with a diversified investment that is professionally managed, with the aim of earning a profit. Mutual funds are often considered a good option for beginners or for people who don't have a lot of money to invest, because they allow investors to spread their money across a wide range of different securities, which can help reduce risk. Next, let's talk about hedge funds. A hedge fund is a type of investment vehicle that is typically only available to accredited investors (people who meet certain income or net worth requirements). Hedge funds are usually more risky and more aggressive than mutual funds, and they often use more complex investment strategies, such as short selling and leverage, to try to generate higher returns. Hedge funds are known for being less regulated than mutual funds, and they often charge higher fees to investors. There are many other types of investment funds as well, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), private equity funds, and venture capital funds. Each of these types of funds has its own unique characteristics and investment strategies, and they may be suitable for different types of investors depending on their risk tolerance and investment goals."],"2476":["The \"God particle\" is a nickname for the Higgs boson, a subatomic particle that was discovered by scientists in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a giant particle accelerator located in Switzerland. It gets its nickname because it is an important part of the Higgs field, which gives mass to other particles, and because it was very difficult to find and study. The Higgs boson was first proposed by physicist Peter Higgs in 1964 as a way to explain why other particles, such as quarks and electrons, have mass. According to the theory, the Higgs field is like a kind of \"cosmic molasses\" that fills the universe and slows down particles as they move through it. The more a particle interacts with the Higgs field, the more mass it has. The Higgs boson is a kind of \"excitation\" or ripple in the Higgs field, and it is this ripple that gives mass to other particles. The discovery of the Higgs boson was a major milestone in our understanding of the universe and the fundamental nature of matter. It helps to confirm the existence of the Higgs field and supports the idea that mass is not an inherent property of particles, but rather something that is imparted on them by their interactions with the Higgs field."],"7879":["Square brackets are used in quotes to add information that was not originally present in the quote.

This is usually done by showing the user an image with distorted text or a series of images with a specific pattern and asking them to enter the text or select the images that match the pattern. \nSpammers might try to use automated programs to send out large numbers of spam messages, but these programs would not be able to solve the captcha. Therefore, captcha systems can effectively block spam because they can distinguish between human users and automated programs. \nOne reason that captcha systems are difficult to break is that they can be designed to be very difficult for a computer to interpret. For example, the text in the image might be distorted in a way that is easy for a human to read but hard for a computer to recognize. Similarly, the pattern of images might be difficult for a computer to recognize without the context that a human would naturally bring to the task. \nOverall, captcha systems are an effective way to prevent spam because they require humans to prove that they are human, which is something that automated programs cannot do."],"392":["There are several techniques that filmmakers use to create the illusion of zero gravity in movies. One technique is called \"forced perspective.\" This involves shooting a scene with the camera at an angle that makes objects in the foreground look larger than they are, while objects in the background appear smaller. This creates the illusion that the objects in the foreground are closer to the camera and are therefore subject to less gravity. \nAnother technique is called \"high-speed photography.\" This involves shooting a scene at a very high frame rate, typically hundreds or thousands of frames per second. When the footage is played back at a normal frame rate, it appears as though the objects in the scene are moving much more slowly than they actually are. This can be used to make it look like objects are floating or moving slowly in a weightless environment. \nIn some cases, filmmakers will also use special effects and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create the illusion of zero gravity. This can involve digitally altering the movement of objects in a scene or creating entirely digital environments that look like they are in space. \nIn the past, filmmakers have also used practical effects to create the illusion of zero gravity. For example, in the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" the filmmakers used a special rig called a \"zero gravity plane\" to simulate weightlessness. The plane would fly in a parabolic pattern, allowing the actors to experience brief periods of weightlessness. The filmmakers then shot the scenes during these periods and used editing techniques to make it look like the actors were in a weightless environment."],"6079":["Pills are designed to work in specific ways in the body.

They work by using a small chip or glass slide that is coated with a grid of very small spots, each of which contains a specific piece of DNA.\r\n\r\nTo use a DNA microarray, scientists will start by preparing a sample of DNA from a person or organism. They will then label this sample with a fluorescent dye, which makes it easier to see under a microscope.\r\n\r\nNext, they will place a drop of the labeled DNA sample onto the microarray chip. The chip is then placed under a special microscope, which allows the scientists to see where the labeled DNA sticks to the spots on the chip.\r\n\r\nEach spot on the chip contains a different piece of DNA, and the pattern of where the labeled DNA sticks to the chip can tell scientists a lot about the sample they are studying.

The size of an engine refers to the total volume of air\/fuel mixture that the engine can combust in a single movement. This volume is measured in liters or cubic inches. A small block engine is generally smaller in size and has a smaller displacement than a big block engine. This means that a small block engine has fewer cylinders and is generally not as powerful as a big block engine. Small block engines are often used in smaller vehicles, such as sedans and coupes, because they are more fuel efficient and produce fewer emissions than big block engines. On the other hand, big block engines are larger in size and have a larger displacement than small block engines. This means that a big block engine has more cylinders and is generally more powerful than a small block engine. Big block engines are often used in larger vehicles, such as trucks and SUVs, because they have more power and can handle the heavier weight of these vehicles. So, to sum it up, small block engines are smaller and less powerful than big block engines, but are more fuel efficient and produce fewer emissions. Big block engines are larger and more powerful than small block engines, but are less fuel efficient and produce more emissions."],"10902":["It's illegal to drive without a seat belt in a car because seat belts are designed to keep you safe in case of an accident.

They are used to convert the instructions written in a programming language into a form that a computer can understand and execute.\\n\\nInterpreters and compilers are used for different purposes, and they solve different problems.\\n\\nInterpreters are used to execute a program immediately, line by line. This means that an interpreter reads each line of the program, translates it into a form that the computer can understand, and then executes it. Because interpreters execute the program line by line, they are slower than compilers, but they are also easier to use and debug. Interpreters are often used for programming languages that are dynamically typed, which means that the type of a variable (e.g., number, string, etc.) can change during the execution of a program.\\n\\nCompilers, on the other hand, are used to translate a program into a form that can be executed later, without the need for the source code to be present. This means that a compiler reads the entire program, translates it into a form that the computer can understand, and then creates a separate executable file that can be run at any time. Because compilers translate the entire program at once, they are faster than interpreters, but they are also more difficult to use and debug. Compilers are often used for programming languages that are statically typed, which means that the type of a variable must be specified when the program is written, and it cannot change during execution.\\n\\nIn short, interpreters and compilers are used to execute programs written in different programming languages, and they solve different problems depending on the needs of the programmer and the characteristics of the programming language being used.\\n"],"16013":["The federal government and the states have their own separate legal systems and laws, and sometimes these laws can conflict with each other.

It is a type of sound that is called a \"misophonia trigger,\" which means that it can cause a strong emotional or physical reaction in some people.\r\n\r\nThere are a few different theories about why this might happen. Some people think it might be because the sound is similar to the sound of nails on a chalkboard, which is a sound that has been associated with danger or discomfort in the past. For example, if you heard someone scratching their nails against a chalkboard when you were a child, you might have associated that sound with something unpleasant, like being punished or scolded.\r\n\r\nOther people think it might be because the sound is so high-pitched and jarring that it can cause a physical reaction in the body, like goosebumps or a feeling of discomfort. It's also possible that the reaction to this sound is partly psychological and partly physical, and that it's a combination of both of these things.\r\n\r\nOverall, the feeling of discomfort that people get when they hear nails on a chalkboard is a normal, natural reaction that is caused by a combination of psychological and physical factors."],"8509":["The International Space Station (ISS) has a system that converts carbon dioxide back into oxygen so that the astronauts on the ISS can breathe.

One of his most famous quotes is \"I think, therefore I am,\" which is often translated as \"Cogito, ergo sum\" in Latin. This phrase is often referred to as the \"Cogito\" and is central to Descartes' philosophical approach, known as \"Cartesian doubt.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the Cogito is that, in order to doubt something, you must first exist. Descartes believed that the act of thinking was the one thing that could not be doubted, and therefore, the very act of thinking proved that the thinker (in this case, the person doing the thinking) must exist.\r\n\r\nDescartes' way of thinking is often compared to that of John Locke, another philosopher who lived around the same time. Like Descartes, Locke believed in the importance of using reason and evidence to understand the world.

A satellite stays in orbit around the Earth because it is constantly falling towards the Earth due to gravity, but it is also moving very fast horizontally. This combination of falling and moving horizontally means that the satellite follows a curved path around the Earth. Imagine you are standing on a hill and you roll a ball down the hill. The ball will roll down the hill and then continue rolling across the flat ground. If you give the ball a big enough push, it will keep rolling and rolling without stopping. This is similar to how a satellite stays in orbit around the Earth. The Earth's gravity pulls the satellite down towards the surface, but the satellite's forward motion keeps it from hitting the ground. Instead, it follows a curved path around the Earth.

Other factors that can affect the price of gasoline include the cost of refining the oil into gasoline, taxes, and transportation and distribution costs. So even if the price of crude oil falls, other costs may not fall at the same time, which means that the price of gasoline may not drop as much as you would expect. \nSecond, the price of gasoline is also influenced by supply and demand. If there is a lot of gasoline available and not many people are buying it, the price might fall. On the other hand, if there is not much gasoline available and a lot of people are trying to buy it, the price might go up. \nFinally, it's worth noting that the price of gasoline can vary widely from place to place, even within the same country. This can be due to a variety of factors, including differences in taxes, transportation costs, and local market conditions. So it's possible that even if the price of gasoline falls in some places, it might not fall as much in other places."],"8721":["Toast tastes better than bread because the process of toasting bread changes its texture and flavor.

This is because nuclear power requires special equipment and shielding to protect the people on the spacecraft and on the ground from radiation. This extra weight and bulk can make it more difficult and expensive to launch a spacecraft into orbit.\r\n\r\nAnother limitation is that nuclear power is not very flexible. It is difficult to turn off and on, and it is difficult to adjust the amount of power that it produces. This can make it hard to control the power usage on a spacecraft, which is important for conserving resources and extending the life of the spacecraft.\r\n\r\nFinally, nuclear power can be dangerous if something goes wrong. If there is an accident or malfunction with the nuclear power system, it could release harmful radiation and cause serious damage to the spacecraft and its crew. This risk is one of the main reasons that nuclear power has not been widely used in spacecraft.\r\n\r\nOverall, while nuclear power can be a very reliable and efficient source of energy, it is not always the best choice for spacecraft due to its weight, inflexibility, and potential dangers."],"3102":["Different dog breeds have different personalities because they were bred for different purposes.

However, there are a few challenges and ethical concerns to consider. First, it can be difficult to safely attach a camera or any other type of equipment to a whale's body. Whales are large, powerful animals, and any equipment that is attached to them needs to be designed and secured in a way that does not harm the whale or interfere with its movement or behavior. Second, there are also ethical concerns about interfering with wild animals, especially when it comes to attaching equipment to their bodies. Scientists and researchers need to be very careful to make sure that any research they do does not cause harm or stress to the animals they are studying. Finally, there are other ways to explore the deep sea that do not involve attaching cameras or other equipment to animals. For example, scientists can use underwater robots or submersibles to study the deep sea, or they can use remotely operated vehicles that are controlled from the surface. These methods allow us to learn more about the deep sea without causing any harm to the animals that live there."],"8556":["Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells in the body grow and divide in an uncontrolled way. When cancer cells grow in an organ, they can spread beyond that organ to other parts of the body. This is called metastasis.\r\n\r\nIf an organ is infected with cancer, removing it (a procedure called surgery) can often help to stop the cancer from spreading. However, it is not always possible to completely remove all of the cancer cells, especially if the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nEven if all of the cancer cells in an organ can be removed, it is not always possible to replace the infected organ with a donor organ. This is because the patient's body may reject the new organ, just like it can reject a transplanted organ in any other situation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, not all types of cancer can be treated with surgery. Some types of cancer, such as leukemia (a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow), cannot be cured by removing an infected organ.\r\n\r\nIn summary, while removing an infected organ can sometimes be an effective way to treat cancer, it is not a cure-all. Other treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, may be necessary to help kill any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back."],"4190":["Electrical plugs with two prongs have a certain orientation because it helps to ensure that they are inserted into the socket in the correct way. This is important because electricity is flowing through the wires inside the plug, and we want to make sure that it is flowing in the right direction.\\n\\nImagine that you have a garden hose with water flowing through it. If you put the hose into a spigot the wrong way, the water won't come out. It's the same with electricity - if the plug is inserted the wrong way, the electricity won't flow correctly and it could cause problems with the device you are trying to use.\\n\\nBy making the plugs a certain shape, it helps us to know which way to insert them so that the electricity flows correctly."],"9022":["It is generally not recommended to watch a microwave while it is running because microwaves emit electromagnetic radiation, which can be harmful if you are exposed to it for too long. The microwaves that are produced inside the microwave oven are used to cook or heat the food, and they do this by causing the water molecules in the food to vibrate rapidly.\r\n\r\nWhen the microwaves are inside the oven, they are contained and do not pose a risk to people. However, if the microwave oven is damaged or not functioning properly, it is possible for some of the microwaves to escape, which is why it is recommended to keep a safe distance from the microwave while it is running.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, staring directly at the microwave while it is running can be harmful to your eyes, so it is best to avoid looking at it directly."],"6000":["In real life, when you try to push your hand through a solid object like a table, you can't do it because the molecules in the table are too close together and they push back against your hand, preventing it from going through. In a video game, the characters and objects are made up of lots of tiny squares called \"pixels,\" and it's hard for the computer to keep track of all of them and make sure they don't go through each other. It's especially hard when the characters or objects are moving around quickly. That's why sometimes in video games you might see things going through each other - it's just really hard for the computer to keep up and make sure everything looks realistic."],"15510":["Cultural relativism is the idea that what is considered to be right or wrong, good or bad, or acceptable or unacceptable varies from one culture to another. In other words, cultural relativism suggests that there is no one set of universal values or morals that apply to all people in all cultures. Instead, people's beliefs, values, and behaviors are shaped by their culture and the specific society they live in.\n\nFor example, in some cultures, it is considered rude to eat with your hands, while in other cultures it is perfectly acceptable. In some cultures, it is customary for women to cover their heads, while in other cultures it is not. In some cultures, it is considered taboo to discuss death or sex in public, while in other cultures it is seen as normal.\n\nCultural relativism can be a helpful way of understanding and respecting the differences between cultures, and it can be a way of avoiding judging others based on our own cultural values. However, it is important to recognize that cultural relativism does not mean that all cultural practices are equally valid or morally right. It simply means that we should be open to understanding and learning about different cultures and their values, rather than imposing our own cultural values on others."],"10229":["Belly fat can be hard to lose because it is affected by a combination of factors, including your diet, exercise habits, and overall lifestyle.\r\n\r\nHere are some reasons why belly fat can be difficult to lose:\r\n\r\nGenetics: Some people may be more prone to carrying fat around their midsection due to their genes.\r\n\r\nHormones: Hormonal imbalances can cause weight gain, particularly in the abdominal area.\r\n\r\nAge: As you get older, your metabolism tends to slow down, which can make it harder to lose weight.\r\n\r\nStress: Chronic stress can lead to weight gain, including belly fat.\r\n\r\nPoor diet: A diet high in processed and sugary foods can contribute to weight gain, including belly fat.\r\n\r\nLack of exercise: If you don't get enough physical activity, it can be harder to lose weight, including belly fat.\r\n\r\nTo lose belly fat, it's important to make healthy lifestyle changes, such as eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise.

A headache can feel like a throbbing or a dull ache, and it can be mild or severe. There are many different kinds of headaches, and they can have different causes.\r\n\r\nOne type of headache is a migraine. A migraine is a type of headache that can cause a throbbing or pulsating sensation in your head. It can also cause other symptoms, such as sensitivity to light, noise, and smells, as well as nausea and vomiting.\r\n\r\nScientists are still trying to understand exactly what causes migraines, but they think that they may be related to changes in the blood vessels in the brain and the chemicals in the brain. Migraines may also be triggered by certain things, such as stress, lack of sleep, or certain foods.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a migraine, your brain and the blood vessels around it may become more active than usual. This can cause the blood vessels to become bigger or smaller, which can lead to the throbbing or pulsating sensation that you feel. The increased activity in your brain can also make you more sensitive to light, noise, and smells.\r\n\r\nIn short, a headache is a pain that can affect your head, and a migraine is a type of headache that can cause a throbbing or pulsating sensation and sensitivity to light, noise, and smells."],"15580":["I'm sorry, but I am an artificial intelligence and do not have access to current events.

This is a very useful property, but it only happens at very low temperatures. Most superconductors need to be cooled to extremely low temperatures, close to absolute zero (-273\u00b0C or -459\u00b0F), in order to become superconducting.However, scientists are trying to find materials that can become superconducting at higher temperatures, including room temperature. This would be a major breakthrough, because it would make it much easier to use superconductors in everyday applications. For example, if we had room temperature superconductors, we could use them to make very efficient electric power grids, high-speed trains, and other technologies that rely on electricity.Unfortunately, we don't yet have room temperature superconductors. Scientists have found some materials that become superconducting at relatively high temperatures, but they still need to be cooled to very low temperatures. There is ongoing research to try to find materials that can become superconducting at even higher temperatures, but it is a very difficult challenge. It may be many years before we have room temperature superconductors."],"4734":["Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally, without any discrimination or preference given to certain types of traffic or websites. This means that internet service providers (ISPs) should not be able to block, slow down, or charge more for access to specific websites or online services.\\n\\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is a government agency that regulates the communications industry in the United States, including the internet. The FCC has the authority to set rules and regulations to ensure that ISPs follow the principle of net neutrality.\\n\\nIn 2015, the FCC adopted net neutrality rules to ensure that all internet traffic is treated equally. However, in 2017, the FCC voted to repeal these rules, which led to a lot of controversy and debate.\\n\\nMany people believe that net neutrality is important because it allows everyone to have equal access to the internet and ensures that all websites and online services are treated fairly. Without net neutrality, ISPs might be able to charge more for access to certain websites or services, or block access to websites that they don't agree with. This could limit people's ability to access the information and resources they need online and could give ISPs too much control over what people can do and see on the internet.\\n\\nThere are ongoing debates and legal challenges about the rules around net neutrality and the FCC's authority to regulate it. Some people argue that the FCC should reinstate its net neutrality rules, while others believe that the government should stay out of regulating the internet and that the free market should be allowed to determine how the internet works."],"7567":["During a nuclear reaction, the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei. This process is called nuclear fission. When the nucleus of an atom splits, it releases a large amount of energy and matter. The matter that is released during a nuclear reaction is called nuclear matter.It's important to note that the total amount of matter in the universe is always conserved. This means that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another. In a nuclear reaction, the matter that is released is actually matter that was already present within the nucleus of the atom. The energy released during a nuclear reaction is a result of the conversion of some of the mass of the nucleus into energy, according to Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2.So to summarize, during a nuclear reaction, the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller nuclei and releases energy and matter. The total amount of matter in the universe remains constant, but the matter that is released during a nuclear reaction was already present within the nucleus of the atom."],"2904":["Shivering while urinating is a normal physiological response that can be caused by a number of factors. One possible reason is that the act of urinating can cause a sudden drop in body temperature, especially if you are standing in a cold place or if you are wearing wet clothes. When your body temperature drops, your muscles can start to shake or shiver in an effort to generate heat and warm your body back up. Another possible reason is that the muscles in your pelvis and abdomen contract and relax as you urinate, which can sometimes cause shivering or trembling. This is a normal part of the process of emptying your bladder and is not usually a cause for concern. Finally, shivering while urinating can also be a sign of anxiety or stress, as the body's natural response to stress can include shivering or trembling. If you are feeling anxious or stressed while you are urinating, this could be a possible cause of your shivering. In general, shivering while urinating is not a cause for concern unless it is accompanied by other unusual symptoms or if it occurs frequently. If you are concerned about your shivering or if it is causing you discomfort, you may want to speak with your healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance."],"11216":["Great question! The reason that everything in our solar system orbits in the same direction is because of the way that the solar system formed. When the solar system was first forming, there was a lot of gas and dust that was swirling around the young Sun. This material came together to form the planets, and as it came together, it all started to spin in the same direction. This is kind of like how ice skaters spin faster when they bring their arms in close to their body - the material in the solar system was spinning faster and faster as it came together. And once everything was formed and started orbiting the Sun, it all continued to move in the same direction because that's the way it was initially spinning. Does that make sense?"],"11668":["Turning light into matter is a process called matter-antimatter annihilation. When matter and antimatter meet, they can be converted into pure energy. Scientists have been able to create matter from energy using particle accelerators, which are large machines that can speed up particles to very high speeds and then collide them together. However, this process requires a lot of energy and has not been very practical. The idea of turning light into matter is still very much in the realm of theoretical physics and it is not yet clear how it could be useful or how it could be achieved."],"6296":["Dogs are intelligent animals, but it is unlikely that they have the same level of understanding of concepts like \"water\" and \"drowning\" as humans do. Dogs are able to learn through association and experience, so if a dog has repeatedly seen a person or other animal struggling in water and then being rescued, it is possible that the dog may understand that being in water can be dangerous and that it is important to help someone who is in trouble in the water. However, it is unlikely that the dog fully understands the scientific concept of the need for oxygen to survive or the specific properties of water that make it necessary for fish to live in it."],"9726":["Men generally have more body and facial hair than women because of differences in the levels of certain hormones in their bodies. These hormones, called androgens, play a role in the development of male physical characteristics, such as facial and body hair.\r\n\r\nIn both men and women, the hair on their bodies is influenced by genetics, which is a set of instructions that a person is born with that determines certain traits, such as hair color and texture. Some people have genes that make them more likely to have a lot of body or facial hair, while others have genes that make them less likely to have as much.\r\n\r\nOverall, the reason men tend to have more body and facial hair than women is due to the effects of hormones and genetics."],"14512":["Milk is actually a very popular drink and can often be found in bars and restaurants, especially in the form of lattes, cappuccinos, and other coffee drinks that use milk. However, milk is not as commonly served on its own as a drink in bars and restaurants for a few reasons: 1. Some people are lactose intolerant, which means they have difficulty digesting milk and can experience stomach pain and other symptoms after drinking it. 2. Milk spoils relatively quickly if it is not kept cold, so it can be difficult for bars and restaurants to keep it fresh for a long time. 3. Milk can be a bit boring on its own compared to other drinks like soda, juice, or alcohol, which may be more appealing to some people when they are out at a bar or restaurant. Overall, while milk is a healthy and nutritious drink, it may not be as practical or popular as other options in certain settings."],"1227":["Airplane windows are not aligned with the seats because it would not be structurally sound to have them that way. The windows on an airplane are actually round, and they are placed in the fuselage (the main body of the airplane) in a way that distributes the weight of the plane evenly. If the windows were aligned with the seats, it would create weak points in the fuselage, which could be dangerous. It's important for the fuselage to be strong so that the airplane can withstand the forces it experiences during flight, such as turbulence and changes in altitude. So, even though it might seem more convenient to have the windows aligned with the seats, it's actually safer to have them placed where they are."],"17037":["Milk can help to neutralize the flavors and textures of certain foods, like chocolate and peanut butter, which can make them more pleasant to eat. This is because milk contains proteins called caseins, which help to coat your tongue and mouth and create a smooth, creamy texture. The fat in milk can also help to coat your tongue and mouth, which can make it feel more satisfying to drink. Additionally, milk contains a balance of nutrients, such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates, which can help to satisfy your hunger and provide energy. So, when you drink milk after eating something sweet or rich, it can help to cleanse your palate and make you feel more satisfied and refreshed."],"742":["Cats may follow their human caregivers into the bathroom for a variety of reasons.

In movies, they often show someone being \"shocked\" back to life with a defibrillator, but in real life it is not quite that simple.A defibrillator gives a strong electrical shock to the heart through patches placed on a person's chest. This shock can sometimes restart the heart's normal rhythm. However, it is not always successful and does not work in every situation.Sometimes, a person's heart cannot be restarted with a defibrillator because there is not enough oxygen in the brain and other organs. This can happen if a person's heart has not been beating for a long time. When this happens, the person may not recover even if their heart starts beating again.Defibrillators can be very helpful in saving lives, but they are not always successful. It is important to call 911 right away if someone is unconscious or not breathing, so that they can get the medical help they need as soon as possible."],"15160":["At the end of \"The Dark Knight,\" Batman (played by Christian Bale) is running from the police because he wanted to protect the reputation of his alter ego, Bruce Wayne. Batman has been working with the police to help stop the villainous Joker, but the Joker has been causing chaos and destruction in Gotham City.\n\nTo protect the people of Gotham, Batman has been willing to break the law and do things that the police might not agree with. For example, he has used his incredible wealth and resources to create advanced gadgets and vehicles that can help him fight crime.\n\nHowever, the police do not know that Batman is actually Bruce Wayne, a billionaire playboy who is well-respected in the city. If the police knew that Bruce Wayne was Batman, they might try to arrest him for breaking the law.\n\nSo, at the end of the movie, Batman decides to sacrifice his own reputation and freedom in order to protect the people of Gotham. He lets the police think that he is a dangerous criminal, and he runs away so that they won't be able to catch him. This way, Batman can continue to fight crime and protect the city without worrying about being arrested."],"6574":["Wolves are thought to have been domesticated because they were easier to tame than other animals due to their social nature. Wolves live in packs and have a hierarchical social structure, with a dominant alpha male and female at the top. This social structure made it easier for humans to establish dominance over wolves and train them to do tasks.Bears and big cats, on the other hand, are generally more solitary animals and do not have the same kind of social structure. This makes them more difficult to tame and train. In addition, bears and big cats are often much larger and stronger than wolves, which can make them more dangerous to work with.Overall, it is likely that wolves were domesticated because they were more social, easier to train, and safer to work with than other large predators."],"5252":["\\nVaccinations do not pass down to your children in the same way that genetic traits are passed down from parent to child. When you get vaccinated, your body produces immunity to a particular disease by creating antibodies to fight it. These antibodies provide protection against the disease, but they do not stay in your body indefinitely.\\n\\nThe immunity provided by vaccines can last for many years, but it can also fade over time. This means that even if you and your partner have both been vaccinated, your children may not be protected from certain diseases when they are born. This is why it is important for children to receive their own vaccinations according to the recommended vaccination schedule.\\n\\nIt's also important to note that even if you and your partner have both been vaccinated, your children may still be at risk of getting certain diseases if they are exposed to them. This is because vaccines are not 100% effective at preventing disease, so it is still possible to get sick even if you have been vaccinated. However, getting vaccinated greatly reduces the risk of getting sick and helps to protect not only yourself, but also those around you who may not be able to get vaccinated due to age or underlying health conditions."],"308":["The moon reflects light from the sun, so it doesn't produce its own light or energy like the sun does. While it is possible to use the moon's light to generate electricity, it is not as practical as using the sun's light because the moon's light is much weaker. The moon is much farther away from the Earth than the sun, so the moon's light has to travel much farther to reach the Earth, which makes it weaker by the time it gets here. Additionally, the moon's light is only present at night, while the sun's light is present during the day, so it would be difficult to use the moon's light as a consistent source of energy. However, scientists and engineers are always looking for new ways to generate electricity, and some are working on ways to use the moon's light or other sources of energy to create electricity."],"3436":["Cancer is difficult to cure because it is a complex disease that can take many different forms and can affect many different parts of the body. When someone has cancer, it means that their cells are growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way. These cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body and damage healthy cells, which can make the person sick. There are many different types of cancer, and each type is treated differently. Some types of cancer can be cured, while others can be managed or controlled for a long time. The treatment for cancer often involves chemotherapy, which is a type of medicine that can kill cancer cells. However, chemotherapy can also harm healthy cells, which can cause side effects such as hair loss, nausea, and fatigue. One of the reasons cancer is so difficult to cure is because it can be hard to find the cancer cells in the body. Sometimes, cancer cells are too small to see or are hiding in a place where it is hard for the medicine to reach them. This can make it difficult to completely destroy all of the cancer cells, which is why cancer can sometimes come back even after it has been treated. Another reason cancer is difficult to cure is because it can be caused by many different things, such as genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices. This means that it can be hard to prevent cancer from happening in the first place, and it can be difficult to predict which people will get cancer. Overall, cancer is a complex and challenging disease that requires a lot of research and effort to understand and treat. While there have been many advances in cancer treatment, there is still a long way to go in finding more effective ways to prevent, diagnose, and cure cancer."],"3130":["Psychoactive drugs are substances that can alter the way we think, feel, and perceive the world around us. Many of these drugs are found in plants, and some of them, like psilocybin mushrooms, have been used for centuries in traditional cultural and spiritual practices. The active psychoactive compounds in these plants, like psilocybin, are thought to have evolved as a way for the plants to protect themselves from being eaten by animals. These compounds can make the plants taste or smell unappealing to animals, or they can cause animals to feel sick after eating them. Over time, as humans and other animals interacted with these plants and learned about their effects, some people began to use them for their psychoactive properties. In this way, the use of psychoactive plants has become a part of human culture and history. It's important to note that while psychoactive plants and substances can have some interesting and potentially beneficial effects, they can also be dangerous and should be used with caution. It's also worth noting that the use of psychoactive substances is not always legal, so it's important to be aware of the laws in your area."],"6045":["Abstraction in computer science is a way of simplifying complex concepts or processes so that we can understand and work with them more easily.\\n\\nFor example, imagine you are a little kid and you want to make a sandwich. You could go into the kitchen, find all the ingredients, and make the sandwich from scratch. But that might be really hard and time-consuming, especially if you don't know how to do it.\\n\\nInstead, you might ask your mom to make the sandwich for you. She knows how to make a sandwich, and she can do it more quickly and easily than you can. This is an example of abstraction: you are using your mom's sandwich-making skills as a \"black box\" that you don't need to understand fully in order to get the result you want (a delicious sandwich).\\n\\nIn computer science, abstraction is used in a similar way. When we write code, we often use pre-existing blocks of code (called \"libraries\") that other people have written. We don't need to understand exactly how these libraries work, we just need to know what they do and how to use them. This helps us write code more quickly and easily, because we don't have to start from scratch every time we want to do something.\\n\\nAbstraction is an important concept in computer science because it helps us manage complexity and make our work more efficient. It's also a key part of the design of many computer systems, because it allows different parts of the system to work together without needing to know all the details of how each part works."],"10828":["Animals use a variety of methods to navigate and find their way back home, even if they are moved far away.\r\n\r\nOne way they do this is by using their senses, such as sight, smell, and hearing, to gather information about their surroundings. For example, a pigeon might use its sense of smell to identify familiar landmarks, or use its keen eyesight to recognize distinctive features of the landscape.\r\n\r\nAnother way animals navigate is by using the Earth's magnetic field. Many animals, including birds, fish, and some insects, have special cells in their bodies that can detect changes in the magnetic field, which helps them orient themselves and navigate in a particular direction.\r\n\r\nFinally, some animals use celestial cues, such as the sun or the stars, to help them navigate. For example, birds might use the position of the sun in the sky to determine which direction is north, and then use this information to fly back home.\r\n\r\nOverall, animals use a combination of their senses and natural navigation skills to find their way back home, even if they are moved far away."],"14338":["It's important to understand that in the criminal justice system, the goal is not just to punish people for their crimes, but also to rehabilitate them and help them become productive members of society. When someone serves their sentence for a crime, it means that they have paid their debt to society and are released back into the community. This is true for all types of crimes, including sex offenses. While it is true that some sex offenders may be more likely to reoffend than others, it is also true that many sex offenders do not reoffend and go on to live productive, law-abiding lives. It is up to the courts and the parole board to determine the specific conditions of an offender's release and to monitor their behavior to ensure that they are not a danger to the community. In some cases, sex offenders may be required to undergo treatment or counseling as part of their rehabilitation, and they may be subject to certain restrictions or conditions on their release, such as not being allowed to be around children or having to register as a sex offender. It is also important to note that the criminal justice system is designed to hold people accountable for their actions and to protect the safety of the community. If an offender is deemed to be a danger to the community and is likely to reoffend, they may be kept in prison for a longer period of time or may be placed in a secure treatment facility."],"4921":["Game shows like \"The Price is Right\" typically have a budget for prizes that they give away on the show.

Here are a few examples:Not paying enough tax throughout the year: If you don't have enough tax taken out of your paychecks throughout the year, you might end up owing the government when you file your tax return. This can happen if you don't adjust your tax withholding correctly or if you have multiple sources of income.Not filing a tax return: If you fail to file a tax return, you might end up owing back taxes. The government relies on tax returns to determine how much tax you owe, so if you don't file a return, you could end up with a bill for unpaid taxes.Self-employment: If you are self-employed, you are responsible for paying your own taxes. This means you need to set aside money to pay your taxes throughout the year. If you don't pay enough, you might end up owing back taxes.Underestimating your tax liability: If you underestimate the amount of tax you owe, you might end up with a bill for unpaid taxes. This can happen if you have a change in your financial situation or if you make a mistake when preparing your tax return.Not paying taxes on additional income: If you receive additional income from sources such as freelance work or investments, you might need to pay taxes on that income. If you don't pay the taxes you owe, you could end up with a bill for unpaid taxes."],"7700":["Comedy writing is the process of creating jokes and comedic material. A comedian will often start by coming up with an idea or concept for a joke, and then they will brainstorm different ways to turn that idea into a funny joke or story. They might start by writing down their ideas in a notebook, or they might talk through their ideas with a friend or fellow comedian to get feedback and help them develop their ideas further. Once they have a strong idea, the comedian will then work on crafting the joke or bit, experimenting with different word choices and delivery methods to make the joke as funny as possible. This process can take a lot of trial and error, as the comedian will often need to try out different versions of the joke in front of an audience to see what works and what doesn't."],"14290":["Great question! The words \"eleven\" and \"twelve\" have been around for a very long time. They come from Old English, and they have stayed pretty much the same since then. The word \"eleven\" comes from Old English \"endleofan,\" which means \"one left\" (since it comes after ten). The word \"twelve\" comes from Old English \"twelf,\" which means \"two left\" (since it comes after ten as well). As for the \"teens,\" they are just the numbers from thirteen to nineteen. They are called the \"teens\" because they all end in the suffix \"-teen,\" which comes from Old English \"ten.\" So \"thirteen\" means \"three ten,\" \"fourteen\" means \"four ten,\" and so on.

Here are a few simple steps you can follow to get started:\r\n\r\nOpen a brokerage account: A brokerage account is a type of account that allows you to buy and sell investments like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. You can open a brokerage account with an online brokerage firm or a traditional financial institution like a bank.\r\n\r\nDetermine your investment goals: Before you start investing, it's important to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve. Are you saving for retirement, a down payment on a house, or some other financial goal? Knowing your goals will help you choose the right investments for your needs.\r\n\r\nChoose your investments: There are many different types of investments you can choose from, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Each has its own set of risks and potential rewards, so it's important to do your research and choose investments that align with your goals and risk tolerance.\r\n\r\nStart investing: Once you've opened a brokerage account and chosen your investments, you can start buying and selling. Many brokerage firms allow you to buy and sell stocks online, so you can easily manage your investments from your computer or phone.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that you don't have to buy large quantities of stock to start investing. Many brokerage firms allow you to buy fractional shares, which means you can buy a portion of a stock rather than a whole share.

RAM stands for \"random access memory,\" and it's a type of computer memory that is used to store data that the computer is currently using or processing. When you open a program or perform a task on your computer, the data needed for that task is loaded into the RAM so that it can be quickly accessed by the computer's processor.DDR4 is the fourth generation of double data rate (DDR) memory, which is a type of RAM that is used in many computers. DDR3 is the third generation of DDR memory. One of the main differences between DDR3 and DDR4 is the speed at which they can transfer data. DDR4 is faster than DDR3, which means that it can transfer data to and from the computer's processor more quickly. This can make the computer feel faster and more responsive when you're using it.DDR4 also uses less power than DDR3, which can help to extend the battery life of laptops and other portable devices. This is because DDR4 has a lower operating voltage than DDR3, which means it requires less power to operate.I hope this helps to explain the difference between DDR3 and DDR4!

Some fonts are easier to read than others, and the choice of font can also convey a certain mood or tone. For example, a formal document might use a more traditional font, while a book intended for children might use a fun, playful font. The designers of the font, or typeface, put a lot of thought and effort into creating a font that is pleasing to look at and easy to read. They may have spent years perfecting the shapes of the letters and the spacing between them to create a font that is aesthetically pleasing and functional. The people who create fonts are called typeface designers, and they are artists in their own right. Just like an artist who creates a painting or sculpture, typeface designers want to be recognized for their work and want to ensure that their font is used in the best possible way. So, when a book includes information about the font at the end, it is a way of acknowledging and thanking the typeface designer for their hard work and creativity. It is also a way of letting readers know what font was used in the book, in case they want to use the same font for their own projects or just want to know more about it."],"13268":["Crows are often seen around because they are a very common type of bird. However, baby crows, or chicks, are usually hidden away in the nest while they are young and growing. The parents take care of them and bring them food. As the chicks get older, they may start to venture out of the nest and explore their surroundings, but they still rely on their parents for food and protection. Once they are fully grown, crows can be seen flying and foraging for food just like adult crows. So you don't see baby crows very often because they stay in the nest until they are big enough to take care of themselves. Does that make sense?"],"5020":["\\nTo calculate the volume of a highly complicated 3D body, you can use a method called \"water displacement.\" This involves filling a container with water and then carefully placing the 3D body into the water. The water will rise and displace an amount of water equal to the volume of the 3D body. You can then measure the amount of water that has been displaced and use that to calculate the volume of the 3D body.\\n\\nFor example, let's say you have a 3D body that is shaped like a pyramid. You can fill a container with water, and then carefully place the pyramid into the water. The water will rise, and you can measure how much it has risen. Let's say the water has risen by 1 liter. This means that the volume of the pyramid is 1 liter.\\n\\nAnother method for calculating the volume of a 3D body is to divide the body into smaller, regular-shaped pieces (such as cubes or spheres), and then calculate the volume of each piece separately. You can then add up the volumes of all of the pieces to get the total volume of the 3D body. This method can be especially useful for highly complicated 3D bodies that are difficult to measure using the water displacement method.\\n\\nI hope this helps!

Larger wheels can provide a smoother ride and better handling, but they can also make the car more difficult to control at high speeds and can be more expensive to replace if they get damaged.One reason that some cars have larger wheels on the back than the front is to improve traction. When a car is turning, the wheels on the outside of the turn have to travel a greater distance than the wheels on the inside of the turn. This can cause the outside wheels to slip or lose traction, especially on wet or slippery roads. By using larger wheels on the back, the car's weight is distributed more evenly, which can help to improve traction and stability.It's important to note that the size of a car's wheels can also affect its fuel efficiency and the wear and tear on its tires. Larger wheels may require more fuel to turn, and the larger surface area of the tires can cause them to wear out more quickly.Overall, the choice of wheel size is a trade-off between various factors, including performance, handling, cost, and fuel efficiency. The best choice will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the driver."],"14906":["A 401k is a type of retirement savings account that is sponsored by an employer. It is named after a section of the U.S. tax code. Employees can contribute a portion of their income to their 401k account, and the employer may also contribute on their behalf. The money in the account can be invested in a variety of financial products, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The goal of a 401k is to help people save money for retirement, so they can have a steady stream of income when they are no longer working.\n\nEmployer matching is when an employer contributes a certain amount of money to an employee's 401k account, usually based on the amount the employee contributes. For example, an employer might match 50% of the employee's contributions up to a certain limit. This can be a good way for employees to boost their retirement savings, because they are essentially getting free money from their employer.\n\nPeople can \"lose\" their 401k if they leave their job or if their employer goes out of business. If this happens, the employee has a few options for their 401k account. They can leave the money in the account with their former employer, roll it over into a new 401k account at their new job, or move it into an individual retirement account (IRA). It's important for people to carefully consider their options and make sure they choose the one that is best for their financial situation."],"16548":["Sure!

The octane rating is a measure of a gasoline's ability to resist \"knocking\" or \"pinging\" during combustion, which can cause engine damage.\n\nRegular gasoline, also known as 87 octane, has a lower octane rating and is suitable for most vehicles. It is the least expensive type of gasoline and is fine to use in most cases.\n\nPlus gasoline, also known as 89 octane, has a slightly higher octane rating than regular gasoline. It is usually a little more expensive than regular gasoline and is usually not necessary for most vehicles. Some car manufacturers may recommend using plus gasoline in certain high-performance vehicles or in certain conditions, such as at high altitudes.\n\nPremium gasoline, also known as 91 or 93 octane, has the highest octane rating. It is more expensive than regular or plus gasoline and is usually not necessary for most vehicles. Some car manufacturers may recommend using premium gasoline in certain high-performance vehicles or in certain conditions, such as at high altitudes.\n\nIn general, you should use the type of gasoline recommended by the manufacturer of your vehicle. You can usually find this information in the owner's manual or by looking for a sticker on the inside of the gas tank door. Using a higher octane gasoline than recommended by the manufacturer is generally not necessary and may not provide any additional benefits."],"11674":["Poker is a game that combines both luck and skill.

While the process of getting a tattoo can be painful, many people choose to undergo the process without using anaesthetics because they do not want to numb the area being tattooed. \nThere are several reasons why people might choose not to use anaesthetics when getting a tattoo. One reason is that some people enjoy the experience of getting a tattoo and see it as a form of body modification or self-expression. They may feel a sense of pride or accomplishment in enduring the pain of the tattoo process. \nAnother reason is that local anaesthetics, which are medications that numb a specific area of the body, can be expensive and may not be covered by insurance. Some people may also be allergic to anaesthetics or may not want to risk the potential side effects of the medication. \nIn addition, some tattoo artists may not offer anaesthetics as an option because they believe that the pain of getting a tattoo is part of the process and may even enhance the tattoo's overall appearance. \nOverall, the decision to use anaesthetics when getting a tattoo is a personal one that depends on an individual's pain tolerance and preferences. If you are considering getting a tattoo and are concerned about the pain, you may want to discuss your options with your tattoo artist and a healthcare provider."],"15038":["On a graph, the slope is the steepness of a line. It tells you how much a line goes up or down as you move to the right.\n\nImagine you are standing at the bottom of a hill and you want to know how steep the hill is. You could measure the slope of the hill by finding the difference in height between two points on the hill and then dividing that number by the distance between those two points. A steep hill would have a bigger slope than a shallow hill.\n\nSlope is important because it can tell you a lot of things about the relationship between two things. For example, if you are studying how the price of a product changes over time, you could make a graph with the price on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. The slope of the line on that graph would tell you how much the price changes for each unit of time. If the slope is steep, the price is changing a lot over time. If the slope is shallow, the price is not changing much over time.\n\nSlope is also important in math and science because it can help you understand and solve problems. For example, if you know the slope of a hill, you can figure out how much energy it would take to roll a ball down the hill or how fast a car would go if it drove down the hill. Slope is a useful way to describe and understand how things change and how they relate to each other."],"9563":["WinRAR is a software company that makes a popular program called WinRAR, which is used to compress and decompress files.

If a candidate gets more votes than any other candidate, they become the president.\n\nAfter a person becomes the president, they can only serve for a certain amount of time (called a term) before they have to step down and someone else becomes the president. The president can only serve for two terms in total, which means they can only be the president for a total of eight years. This is because the founders of the United States wanted to make sure that no one person could be in charge for too long and that there would be a chance for new people to have a chance to lead the country.\n\nSo, if a person who is not already the president (called a non-incumbent) wants to be the president, they can only try to get elected once. If they lose the election, they cannot try to become the president again. This means that if a non-incumbent candidate is not successful in their first attempt at becoming the president, they do not get a second chance.\n\nHowever, if a person has already been the president and has served for two terms, they can no longer be the president again. This means that if a president wants to have a second chance at being the president, they have to wait until after someone else has been the president for at least two terms.\n\nIn summary, in the United States, non-incumbent candidates only get one chance to become the president, and incumbent presidents can only serve for a total of two terms.

One of the main reasons that meth use can ruin teeth is because the drug can cause users to grind their teeth, also known as bruxism. This constant grinding can wear down the teeth and cause them to break or become loose. Meth can also cause dry mouth, which can lead to tooth decay. When the mouth is dry, there is less saliva to help wash away bacteria and food particles that can contribute to tooth decay. In addition, meth use can lead to poor nutrition, which can also affect the health of teeth. People who use meth may not eat enough healthy foods or may not take care of their teeth as well as they should, both of which can contribute to tooth decay and other dental problems. Finally, meth can cause a person to have obsessive or compulsive behaviors, including picking at the skin or lips or biting their nails, which can also damage teeth.

The numbers and letters on the bottle of motor oil, like 5w-30 or 10w-40, refer to the oil's viscosity, or how thick it is. The first number, such as 5 or 10, refers to the oil's viscosity when the engine is cold. The \"W\" stands for \"winter,\" so a 5W oil is thinner when cold than a 10W oil. Thinner oils flow more easily and can help reduce wear on the engine when it's cold, but they may not provide as much protection at high temperatures. The second number, such as 30 or 40, refers to the oil's viscosity when the engine is hot. A 30 oil will thin out less when hot than a 40 oil, so it will provide better protection at high temperatures.

If you are found guilty of a crime, the judge will consider the evidence presented and decide on a sentence based on the severity of the crime and any other relevant factors.\n\nIt is generally a good idea to cooperate with the police and identify yourself if you are stopped or questioned, as refusing to do so can sometimes lead to additional legal problems. However, you do have the right to remain silent and to not answer any questions if you are being questioned by the police as a suspect in a crime. You should always consult with an attorney if you have questions about your rights and legal options."],"3762":["When a giant asteroid hits the Earth, it can create a very large explosion because of the energy that is released when it collides with the Earth's surface. This is similar to what happens when two objects collide at high speeds, like when two cars crash into each other. The energy from the impact is converted into heat and light, which can cause a bright flash and a loud noise. Asteroids are not naturally explosive, but they can create explosions when they collide with other objects because of the energy that is released. This is called an impact explosion. The size of the explosion depends on the size of the asteroid and the speed at which it is traveling when it hits the Earth. In movies and TV shows, the explosions that are shown when an asteroid hits the Earth are often exaggerated for dramatic effect. They are not necessarily meant to be realistic representations of what would really happen."],"10252":["Ice cream shops often have a slower season in the winter because people tend to want warmer, comfort foods when it's cold outside. However, there are still ways for ice cream shop owners to make money during the winter months.\r\n\r\nOne way is by offering other types of frozen treats, such as Italian ices or frozen yogurts, which may be more popular in the colder months. These treats are often made with fruit or other flavors that are refreshing and not as heavy as traditional ice cream.\r\n\r\nAnother way is by offering hot drinks, such as coffee or hot cocoa, which can help attract customers looking for a warm beverage. Some ice cream shops may also offer warm, comfort foods like soups or sandwiches to attract customers looking for a quick meal.\r\n\r\nFinally, ice cream shop owners can also consider offering special promotions or discounts to attract customers during the slower season. For example, they might offer a discount on a purchase if a customer brings in a flyer or coupon, or they might offer a \"buy one, get one free\" deal on a particular item. By offering these types of promotions, ice cream shop owners can help bring in more business and make money during the winter months."],"2719":["MegaUpload was a file hosting and sharing service that allowed users to upload and share large files such as music, movies, and other types of content. RapidShare is another file hosting and sharing service that operates in a similar way. One key difference between the two services is that MegaUpload faced legal challenges and was eventually shut down by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2012. The U.S. government alleged that MegaUpload was being used to distribute and share copyrighted material illegally, and the company's founder, Kim Dotcom, was arrested and charged with various crimes related to copyright infringement. In contrast, RapidShare has not faced similar legal challenges, and as a result, it has continued to operate. However, it is important to note that both MegaUpload and RapidShare have been used to share both legal and illegal content, and it is the responsibility of users to ensure that they are not violating copyright laws when using these or any other file sharing services."],"6752":["Sound waves are not made up of particles like light waves are. Instead, sound is a type of energy that travels through matter, such as air, water, or solid objects.When an object vibrates, it causes the molecules around it to vibrate as well. These vibrating molecules then bump into other molecules, passing on the energy of the vibration. This chain reaction continues until the energy reaches your ear, where it is converted into a sound that your brain can understand.So, to sum it up, sound waves are created by vibrations and travel through matter (like air or water) to your ears, where they are turned into the sounds that you hear."],"7277":["Sweat itself is actually colorless and odorless. However, when it comes into contact with certain substances, it can cause stains that appear yellow or brown. One of these substances is deodorant, which can contain aluminum-based compounds that can react with sweat to produce yellow stains. Another substance that can cause yellow stains is the protein called urea, which is found in sweat. When urea reacts with certain materials, it can produce a yellowish discoloration. Finally, some people have naturally higher levels of certain substances in their sweat, such as fatty acids, that can cause yellow stains on clothes."],"14900":["Sure! Whiskey is a type of alcohol made from grain, such as barley, corn, rye, or wheat. There are many different types of whiskey, and they can be distinguished by how they are made and what they are made from.\n\nHere's a breakdown of some common types of whiskey:\n\nSingle Malt Whiskey: This type of whiskey is made from malted barley and water, and it is produced at a single distillery. Single malt whiskey is often associated with Scotland, but it can also be made in other countries.\n\nTriple Distilled Whiskey: This type of whiskey is made by distilling the alcohol three times, which can result in a smoother and more refined flavor. Triple distilled whiskey is often made in Ireland.\n\nScotch Whiskey: Scotch whiskey is a type of whiskey that is made in Scotland from malted barley, water, and yeast. It must be aged for at least three years in oak barrels to be called Scotch.\n\nBourbon Whiskey: Bourbon is a type of American whiskey that is made from a mixture of grains, including at least 51% corn. It is aged in new, charred oak barrels, which gives it a distinct flavor and color.\n\nI hope this helps explain the differences between these types of whiskey! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"9780":["Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally, without any discrimination or preference given to certain types of traffic or websites. It ensures that internet service providers (ISPs) cannot block or slow down access to any particular websites or online services, or charge more for faster access to some websites.\r\n\r\nIf net neutrality is \"killed,\" it means that ISPs would be able to discriminate against certain types of traffic or websites in various ways. For example, they could block access to certain websites entirely, or slow down access to them. They could also create \"fast lanes\" for websites or services that are willing to pay extra fees, meaning that those websites would load faster for users than other websites that are not willing or able to pay the fees.\r\n\r\nThis could have a number of negative consequences for the average consumer. For one thing, it could make it harder for people to access the websites and online services that they want to use. It could also make it more expensive to use certain websites or services, if they are only available in the \"fast lane\" and you have to pay extra fees to access them. Additionally, it could lead to a situation where only the largest and most powerful websites and online services are able to afford to pay the fees to be in the fast lane, while smaller or newer websites and services are left in the slow lane and are at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nOverall, the elimination of net neutrality could lead to a less open and less competitive internet, with fewer choices and potentially higher costs for consumers."],"14289":["In soccer, additional time, also known as \"stoppage time\" or \"injury time,\" is a way for the referee to compensate for time that is lost during the game due to things like injuries, substitutions, and other interruptions. The amount of additional time that is added can vary, but it is usually between one and five minutes. The referee determines how much additional time to add at the end of each half of the game. They do this by looking at their watch and adding up the amount of time that was lost during the half due to interruptions. For example, if there were several injuries that required players to be treated and substituted, or if the ball went out of bounds and had to be retrieved, the referee might add a couple of minutes of additional time to make up for that lost time. The purpose of adding additional time is to try to ensure that each half of the game is the same length, even if there were interruptions. This helps to keep the game fair for both teams. Benefits of additional time include ensuring that each half is the same length, ensuring that the game is played for the full duration, and ensuring that the game ends at the correct time."],"8766":["There is a common belief that people who have higher levels of education, especially in the liberal arts and social sciences, are more likely to hold liberal or left-leaning political views. This belief is not necessarily true for all individuals, as people of all education levels can hold a variety of political views. However, there are a few reasons why this perception may exist.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that higher levels of education often expose people to a wider range of ideas and ways of thinking. This can lead to a greater understanding of and appreciation for diversity, equality, and social justice, which are often associated with liberal or left-leaning political views.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that people who have higher levels of education may be more likely to engage in critical thinking and to challenge traditional beliefs and systems. This can lead them to support political ideologies that advocate for change and progress, rather than maintaining the status quo.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. In other words, just because there is a relationship between education and political views does not necessarily mean that one causes the other. There may be other factors at play that contribute to both the level of education someone has and their political views."],"9151":["Green screens are green because the color green is easier to see on camera and is easier to remove from the final product.\r\n\r\nWhen a person or object is filmed in front of a green screen, the camera can easily detect the green color and separate it from the rest of the image. This is because the color green is not typically found in skin tones, clothing, or other objects that might be in the frame.\r\n\r\nAfter the green color has been detected, a computer program can remove it from the final image and replace it with a different background. This is called chroma keying, and it is often used in movies and television shows to create special effects.\r\n\r\nSo, the reason green screens are green is because it is easier to use a computer to remove the green color from the final image and replace it with something else. Blue and red are not used as often because they are more difficult to remove and can create more problems with the final image."],"13210":["Postage stamps are necessary because they allow us to send mail through the postal service. When you want to send a letter or package to someone, you put it in an envelope and put a stamp on it. The stamp shows that you have paid the cost of sending the mail through the postal service. The postal service will then deliver the mail to the person you are sending it to. Without postage stamps, people would have to pay for each piece of mail they send separately, which could be very inconvenient. Stamps make it easy to send mail because you can buy them in advance and then use them whenever you need to send something. They also make it possible for the postal service to know how much to charge for delivering different types of mail, such as letters, packages, and postcards."],"8565":["When you read a sentence, your brain is able to understand the meaning of the sentence and pick out the most important information. In this case, the word \"the\" is not a very important word in the sentence, so your brain might not pay as much attention to it. Instead, your brain focuses on the other words in the sentence that carry more meaning, like \"brain\" and \"recognize.\"\r\n\r\nThink of it like this: Imagine you are looking for your favorite toy in your room. You might look at all the toys in your room, but your brain will focus on the toy that you are looking for and ignore the others. It's the same with reading a sentence. Your brain will focus on the words that are most important to understanding the meaning of the sentence and might not pay as much attention to the words that aren't as important."],"1377":["Anesthesia is a medical treatment that is used to help people fall asleep or lose consciousness during a medical procedure. When a person is under anesthesia, their body is temporarily unable to feel pain or move. \nWhile being under anesthesia can be similar to sleeping in some ways, it is not the same as sleep. During sleep, the body naturally relaxes and becomes less aware of its surroundings. The brain and body also go through a series of changes as they rest and repair themselves. \nAnesthesia, on the other hand, is induced by medications that are given to a person before a medical procedure. These medications work to block pain signals and cause the person to lose consciousness. The person remains under the effects of the anesthesia until the medications wear off, which can take a few hours. \nIn short, being under anesthesia is a temporary state that is induced by medications, while sleep is a natural process that occurs during certain times of the day and night."],"15494":["Time seems to go faster as we get older because our brains perceive time differently at different ages. When we are young, we have a lot of new experiences and everything seems to take a long time because it takes us longer to process and understand all of the new information. As we get older, we have fewer new experiences and things become more routine, so time seems to pass more quickly.\n\nAnother reason time might seem to go faster as we get older is because we are more likely to compare the present to the past as we age. When we are young, the past is not as long, so it seems like less time has passed. But as we get older, the past becomes longer and it feels like more time has passed, which can make the present seem to go by more quickly.\n\nFinally, time can seem to go faster as we get older because we are often busier and have more responsibilities, which can make the days feel shorter because we are constantly busy and don't have as much time to just relax and enjoy the moment.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"3754":["Eyebrows are a feature on your face that help keep sweat, dirt, and other things from getting into your eyes.

This is because cats are not as well adapted to being in the water as some other animals are.Cats do not have the same water-resistant fur as some other animals, like otters or seals, which makes it harder for them to swim. They also do not have webbed paws like ducks or other water birds, which makes it harder for them to move through the water.Additionally, cats are predators, and they are used to hunting on land rather than in the water. This means that they may not feel as comfortable or confident in the water as they do on land.Overall, it is not uncommon for cats to be hesitant or even scared when they are first introduced to water, but with time and positive reinforcement, many cats can learn to enjoy swimming or being around water."],"6708":["A red square can be considered art if it is created by an artist and is intended to be a work of art. The value of a work of art is not determined by how easy or difficult it was to create, but rather by the ideas and emotions that it expresses and the skill with which it was made.An artist might create a red square as a way to explore color, shape, or form, or to make a statement about the world around them. The red square might be part of a larger work of art, such as a painting or sculpture, or it might be a standalone piece.Whether or not a red square is considered art is ultimately up to the viewer. Some people might see it as a simple, everyday object, while others might see it as a powerful and meaningful work of art."],"12182":["Bees are really important for our environment because they help pollinate flowers and plants. Pollination is when bees transfer the pollen from one plant to another, and this helps the plants grow and produce food, like fruit and vegetables. Some people are worried about bees because there are fewer of them than there used to be. This is called \"bee decline\" or \"colony collapse disorder,\" and it can be caused by things like pests and diseases, changes in the environment, and the use of certain pesticides. When there are fewer bees, it can be harder for plants to grow and produce food, which can be a problem for people and animals that rely on those plants for food."],"3903":["Sure thing! A panic attack is when your body and brain go into a state of high alert, even when there isn't any real danger. It's kind of like when you're on a rollercoaster and your heart starts pounding and you feel like you can't catch your breath. It's scary, but it's not actually dangerous. Panic attacks can be caused by different things, like stress, anxiety, or certain medical conditions. They can also happen for no reason at all. Some people who have panic attacks get them once in a while, while others get them a lot. If you're having a panic attack, it's important to try to stay calm and remind yourself that it will end. You can also try some deep breathing or other relaxation techniques to help you feel better. If you have panic attacks a lot, it might be helpful to talk to a doctor or a therapist who can help you learn ways to manage them."],"11044":["Asphalt is a type of black, sticky substance that is used to make roads. It's used because it's strong and durable, which makes it good for supporting heavy vehicles like cars, trucks, and buses. It's also smooth, which makes it comfortable to drive on. Asphalt is made from a mixture of small stones, sand, and a sticky substance called bitumen.\r\n\r\nAsphalt can break and get damaged over time, especially if it's not taken care of. This can cause potholes, which are small holes in the road that can be dangerous for drivers and can damage cars. To fix potholes and keep roads in good condition, road crews will fill them in with new asphalt or patch them up with a different material.\r\n\r\nThere are other materials that are sometimes used to make roads, like concrete or brick. But asphalt is still a popular choice because it's relatively cheap, easy to work with, and lasts a long time if it's maintained properly."],"4134":["It can be challenging for NCAA athletes to balance traveling for their sport and college work, especially during busy times like March Madness. However, there are a few things that can help them manage their time and responsibilities more effectively:\\n\\nPlanning ahead: NCAA athletes can try to plan their schedules as far in advance as possible so they know what to expect and can make arrangements for things like missing classes or completing assignments while they are on the road.\\n\\nCommunicating with professors: It is important for NCAA athletes to communicate with their professors about their travel schedules and any conflicts that may arise. Professors may be able to provide accommodations such as allowing the athlete to make up missed assignments or exams, or allowing them to complete coursework online while they are away.\\n\\nStaying organized: NCAA athletes should try to stay organized and keep track of their assignments, deadlines, and other responsibilities. This can help them stay on top of their work and avoid falling behind.\\n\\nSeeking support: NCAA athletes may also find it helpful to seek support from their coaches, academic advisors, and other resources on campus, such as tutoring or study groups, to help them manage their responsibilities.\\n\\nOverall, it takes a lot of discipline and time management skills to balance college work and traveling for a sport. However, with the right strategies and support, it is possible to successfully manage both."],"9794":["A cult is a group of people who have a shared belief system and practices that are not widely accepted by society. Cults are often seen as negative because they may involve manipulating or brainwashing members, leading to harm or exploitation. In contrast, a religion is a belief system that is widely accepted and followed by a large number of people. There are many different religions, each with their own set of beliefs and practices.\r\n\r\nOne way to differentiate between a cult and a religion is by looking at the size and scope of the group. Religions tend to be much larger and more widely accepted than cults, which are usually smaller and more fringe. Cults may also have more extreme or unorthodox beliefs, or may prioritize the needs of the group or its leaders over the well-being of individual members.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that not all small or unconventional belief systems are cults, and not all cults are necessarily harmful. However, it's generally accepted that cults can be harmful and can cause harm to their members or to society, while religions are generally seen as positive and fulfilling."],"7599":["Rechargeable batteries are made differently than normal batteries, so that they can be used over and over again. Normal batteries are made with chemicals that are used up when the battery is used, and once they are used up the battery no longer works. Rechargeable batteries are made with different chemicals that can be used up and then recharged by adding more electricity back into the battery. This is like a glass of water that can be emptied and then filled back up again.

Here is a simplified explanation:\n\nNorth Korea is a country in East Asia that has been ruled by the same family (the Kims) for several generations. The current leader, Kim Jong-un, is the grandson of the country's founder, Kim Il-sung.\n\nThe United States is a country located in North America that has a long history of political and military involvement in other parts of the world. The United States and North Korea have had a difficult relationship for many years, partly because they have different political systems and values.\n\nOne of the main issues between the United States and North Korea is the issue of nuclear weapons. North Korea has developed nuclear weapons, which the United States and many other countries see as a threat to global security. The United States has also imposed economic sanctions on North Korea in an effort to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.\n\nAnother factor that has contributed to the strained relationship is the fact that North Korea has a history of human rights abuses. The North Korean government has been accused of violating the rights of its own citizens, including political prisoners and people who try to leave the country without permission.\n\nIt's important to note that the relationship between the United States and North Korea is complex, and there are many other factors that have contributed to the tension between the two countries. However, these are some of the main reasons why North Korea and the United States have had a difficult relationship."],"1616":["A paradox is a statement or situation that seems to be contradictory or impossible, but might still be true. Some examples of paradoxes are \"this statement is a lie\" and \"I always lie.\" To create a paradox, you can try to make a statement that contradicts itself or that goes against common sense. For example, you could say \"I am lying right now\" or \"I am standing on the edge of a cliff and jumping off, but I will never hit the ground.\" These statements seem impossible, but they are still considered paradoxes. The implications of a paradox are that it can be confusing or hard to understand. It can also make you think about things in a different way and challenge your assumptions. Paradoxes are sometimes used in literature, philosophy, and science to spark new ideas and to make people think more deeply about the world around them."],"14420":["\"Knots\" in your back are actually just areas of your muscles that feel tight and may be painful. They can be caused by a variety of things, including stress, poor posture, overuse, and muscle strain or injury. When you have a knot in your muscle, it means that the muscle is tight and tense. It might feel like a small, hard bump under your skin. Sometimes, knots can be worked out by massaging the muscle, stretching it, or applying heat to it."],"1517":["Viruses like measles and the flu can begin in different ways. In the case of measles, a person can contract the virus by coming into contact with an infected person's respiratory secretions, such as saliva or mucus, when they cough, sneeze, or talk.

One reason is to cover up the smell of their poop so that other animals won't be able to smell it and know that they are in the area. This can help to protect the cat from predators, because if other animals can't smell the cat's poop, they might not be able to find the cat. Another reason that cats bury their poop is to mark their territory. Cats have scent glands on their paws, and when they bury their poop, they are also marking the area with their scent. This can help to keep other cats away from their territory. Overall, the reason that cats bury their poop is to keep themselves safe and to mark their territory. It's something that they do naturally and is a part of their instinct."],"16171":["It is generally not a good idea for companies to advertise negatively about their competition because it can lead to bad feelings and may not be seen as fair or honest. In some cases, it might even be against the law.\n\nIn the United States, for example, there are laws that prohibit companies from making false or misleading claims about their own products or the products of their competitors. This means that if a company wants to advertise negatively about another company's product, they need to be careful to make sure that what they are saying is true and can be backed up with evidence.\n\nIt is generally better for companies to focus on promoting their own products and highlighting the benefits and features that make them unique and valuable, rather than trying to tear down their competition. This can help to create a positive image for the company and build trust with consumers."],"6808":["Certain smells are generally accepted as good or bad because of the associations we have with them and the way they make us feel. For example, the smell of cinnamon buns is often associated with warm, cozy feelings, and the smell of freshly baked bread or cookies can be comforting and pleasing. On the other hand, the smell of poop is often unpleasant because it is associated with waste and can indicate the presence of harmful bacteria.The way our brains process smells also plays a role in how we perceive them. Our brains have evolved to associate certain smells with certain things, and these associations can be based on our experiences and the meanings that we have learned to associate with them. For example, we might associate the smell of flowers with beauty and the smell of rotten food with decay and danger.Overall, the way we perceive and respond to smells is complex and can be influenced by many different factors, including our cultural and personal experiences, the memories and emotions that they evoke, and the physiological effects they have on our bodies."],"13889":["There are actually a few reasons why someone might not want to buy a $1 house in Detroit, even though it might seem like a good deal at first. One reason is that these houses are often in very poor condition and need a lot of work before they can be lived in. This can be expensive and time-consuming, and it's not something that everyone is willing or able to do. Another reason is that many of these houses are located in neighborhoods that are not very safe or desirable to live in. This can make it difficult for someone to sell the house later on, even if they do fix it up. Finally, buying a house of any kind is a big financial commitment, and it's not something that everyone is ready to take on, especially if they don't have a lot of money to begin with."],"7017":["There are a few different ways that people in the past were able to create fountains that shot water upward without electricity. One way was to use gravity to cause the water to flow downward from a higher location, and then use the force of the falling water to push the water upward again through a series of tubes and valves. This is called a \"jet fountain,\" and it works because the water falling from a height has a lot of potential energy, which is converted into kinetic energy (the energy of motion) as it falls. When the water hits the bottom of the fountain, it can be directed through a pipe or series of tubes that lead it back up to the top of the fountain, where it is then released into the air in a jet or a spray. This type of fountain can be quite impressive and can shoot water up quite high into the air."],"6776":["Lactose intolerance is a condition where a person's body is unable to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. It is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme lactase, which is needed to break down lactose. People who are lactose intolerant may experience symptoms like bloating, gas, diarrhea, and abdominal pain after consuming dairy products.However, lactose intolerance is not the same thing as a milk allergy, which is a different immune system reaction to milk proteins. Some people may be allergic to milk, but not lactose intolerant, and vice versa.Lactose intolerance is more common in some parts of the world than others. It is more common in people of African, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American descent than in people of European descent. However, this does not mean that all people of these ancestry groups are lactose intolerant, or that all people of European descent are able to digest lactose without any problems.In some parts of the world, including Japan, milk and other dairy products are not a traditional part of the diet. However, milk and dairy products are now more commonly consumed in these countries, and many people, including Japanese schoolchildren, are able to drink milk without experiencing any problems. This may be because they have learned to tolerate lactose as they have been exposed to milk and other dairy products throughout their lives, or because they have developed lactase enzyme through genetics."],"9440":["Bombs rely on a chemical reaction to create an explosion, and this reaction requires oxygen to occur. When a bomb is placed in a vacuum, where there is no oxygen, the chemical reaction cannot take place and the bomb will not explode.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's important to note that vacuum covers are not designed to be used as bomb shelters. Vacuum covers are used to protect objects from dirt and dust, not to protect against explosions. It is not safe to use vacuum covers as a means of protecting yourself from bombs. If you need to seek shelter from a bomb, you should find a safe place such as a basement or an underground shelter."],"12484":["It is not currently possible to keep a person alive forever using machines. While it is possible to use machines to support certain bodily functions, such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys, the human body is made up of many complex systems that must work together for a person to stay alive. These systems can be damaged or deteriorate over time, and even with the best medical care and technology, it is not possible to completely prevent aging and death. However, there are some medical procedures and technologies that can help extend a person's life or improve their quality of life. For example, a person with heart failure may be given a pacemaker, which is a small device that helps regulate their heart rhythm. A person with kidney failure may need dialysis, which is a procedure that filters waste and excess fluids from the blood using a machine. These treatments can help a person live longer and feel better, but they do not stop the natural process of aging and ultimately, death."],"9332":["I'm sorry, but I'm not able to access current information about the air quality in Shanghai. However, there are several factors that can contribute to air pollution in any city, including Shanghai.\r\n\r\nOne factor is the amount of pollution that is being produced by factories and power plants. These types of facilities release harmful substances, such as carbon dioxide and other gases, into the air.\r\n\r\nAnother factor is the number of cars and other vehicles on the roads. These vehicles also produce pollution, especially when they burn fossil fuels like gasoline or diesel.\r\n\r\nAir pollution can also be caused by burning trash or other materials, or by natural events like forest fires.\r\n\r\nOverall, air pollution is caused when harmful substances get mixed into the air we breathe, which can have negative effects on our health and the environment."],"6403":["There are a few reasons why it is not a good idea to bring African animals, like elephants and rhinos, to live in the southern United States.First, these animals are native to Africa, and they have evolved to live in a specific type of environment and climate. If we were to bring them to the United States, they might not be able to survive in the different climate and habitat.Second, it can be difficult to provide the necessary care and support for these animals in a new environment. Elephants and rhinos have specific dietary and social needs that can be difficult to meet in a new place.Finally, it is important to respect the fact that these animals are an important part of Africa's biodiversity and cultural heritage. It is not appropriate to take them from their natural home and bring them to a different country, even if we think we could provide better care for them.Instead of trying to bring African animals to the United States, it is better to work to protect and preserve their natural habitats in Africa, so that they can continue to thrive in their native environment."],"10819":["Daylight Saving Time (DST) is a system that adjusts the official time of a region or country by moving the clock ahead by one hour for a certain part of the year. The main purpose of DST is to make better use of natural daylight by extending the amount of daylight in the evenings.\r\n\r\nIn the past, DST was introduced as a way to save energy. By extending the amount of daylight in the evenings, people were able to use less electricity for lighting and other household appliances. However, it is not clear whether DST still serves this purpose today, as energy consumption patterns have changed significantly since DST was first introduced. Some studies have suggested that DST may not actually save energy, while others have found that it can result in a small reduction in energy use.\r\n\r\nDespite the uncertain benefits of DST, it is still observed in many parts of the world. Some people argue that DST helps to promote outdoor activities and tourism, while others believe that it can improve road safety by reducing the number of accidents that occur during the darker evening hours.\r\n\r\nOverall, the purpose of DST is to make better use of natural daylight, but whether or not it is still necessary in the modern world is a matter of debate."],"11309":["Sure! \"Void where prohibited\" is a phrase that you might see in a contest or sweepstakes rules. It means that the contest or sweepstakes is not allowed to be played in certain places. These places might be countries, states, or even specific cities. The reason the contest or sweepstakes might not be allowed in these places is because the laws in those places don't allow it. So, if you see this phrase, it means that you can't enter the contest or sweepstakes if you live in one of the places where it's not allowed."],"2843":["Sure, I can try to explain the plot of \"Donnie Darko\" to you in a way that is easy to understand. The movie is about a teenager named Donnie who starts seeing strange things and having strange experiences. One night, he is visited by a figure in a rabbit costume who tells him that the world is going to end in 28 days. The rabbit, named Frank, tells Donnie that he has been chosen to prevent the end of the world. As the days pass, Donnie starts to uncover a mystery involving time travel, alternate realities, and a group of people who are trying to change the course of history. Along the way, he meets a girl named Gretchen, who helps him try to figure out what is happening. At the end of the movie, it is revealed that Donnie has been traveling through time, and that he has the power to change the past and alter the future. He ultimately decides to go back in time and prevent the disaster that Frank had warned him about, sacrificing his own life in the process. So, in short, \"Donnie Darko\" is a movie about a teenager who is given the power to change the world, and the choices he makes as he tries to prevent a disaster from occurring."],"9118":["The Illuminati is a term used to refer to a secret society that is said to have influenced the world in various ways. Some people believe that the Illuminati is a group of powerful individuals who control governments, financial systems, and other institutions. Others think that the Illuminati is a myth or a conspiracy theory.\r\n\r\nThere is no solid evidence to support the existence of the Illuminati, and many of the claims made about them are not based in fact. Some people believe that the Illuminati is a secret society that has existed for centuries, while others think that it is a relatively modern idea.\r\n\r\nThere are many different theories about what the Illuminati is and what they do, but most of these theories are not supported by evidence. Some people think that the Illuminati is a group of powerful people who are working to create a New World Order, a single global government that would control the entire world. Others think that the Illuminati is a group of powerful people who are working to bring about the end of the world.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of speculation and conspiracy theory surrounding the Illuminati, and it is difficult to know what is true and what is not. However, it is generally agreed upon that the Illuminati is not a real organization and that many of the claims made about them are not based in fact."],"15115":["There are many factors that contribute to the disproportionate rate at which African Americans are incarcerated compared to whites. One factor is that African Americans are more likely to live in poverty, which is often associated with higher rates of crime. Additionally, research has shown that there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, including in policing, sentencing, and parole decisions. This means that African Americans may be more likely to be arrested, charged, and sentenced more harshly for the same crimes as whites.\n\nIt is important to note that while crime rates may vary among different racial and ethnic groups, this does not necessarily mean that one group is more criminal than another. Rather, there are complex social and economic factors that contribute to differences in crime rates, and it is important to address these underlying issues in order to address inequalities in the criminal justice system."],"11717":["It's hard to say exactly when humans first became aware of their own existence, but it is likely that this happened very early in our history as a species. People have always been curious and have always wanted to understand the world around them, so it is likely that we have always been aware of ourselves in some way.\r\n\r\nAs for realizing that we are intelligent and capable of creating things and organizing things, this is also something that likely happened very early in our history. Humans have always been good at adapting to their environments and finding ways to survive, and this has often involved coming up with new ideas and finding creative solutions to problems.\r\n\r\nSo, it's hard to pin down one specific moment when these things happened, but it is safe to say that they have been a part of who we are as a species for a very long time."],"5470":["Nuclear bombs are much more powerful than normal bombs because they release a huge amount of energy when they explode. This energy comes from the nucleus, or center, of an atom. When the nucleus of an atom is split, or when two nuclei come together and fuse, a large amount of energy is released. This energy can be used to create a very powerful explosion.\\n\\nThe reason that nuclear bombs can create so much damage is because of the large amount of energy that they release. When a nuclear bomb explodes, it creates a shock wave that can knock down buildings, create huge craters, and cause other damage over a wide area. The blast wave from a nuclear bomb can also cause fires, which can spread and cause even more damage.\\n\\nThe fall out from a nuclear bomb is dangerous because it can release radioactive particles into the air. These particles can be inhaled or ingested, and they can cause radiation sickness, cancer, and other serious health problems. The radioactive particles can also contaminate the ground, water, and other things that people rely on, making it difficult or impossible to use them."],"8932":["It is not appropriate to speculate on what might have happened in a hypothetical situation. In general, if someone kills another person, they may face criminal charges for murder or manslaughter, depending on the circumstances. However, the law also allows for the defense of self-defense, which means that a person may use force to defend themselves or others if they reasonably believe that it is necessary to prevent imminent harm or death. If the three women you mentioned killed Ariel Castro while they were being held captive in his home, and they were able to demonstrate that they acted in self-defense, they may be able to use that as a defense against any criminal charges. However, the specifics of the situation would need to be carefully examined to determine what, if any, charges might be appropriate."],"11013":["The Great Firewall of China is a system that the Chinese government uses to censor the internet and block access to certain websites and platforms within China. It is not installed on every individual computer, but rather it is a system of servers and technologies that work together to block access to certain content. When someone in China tries to access a website or platform that is blocked by the Great Firewall, they will be unable to reach it because the request is intercepted by the servers in the firewall system and blocked before it can reach the intended destination. The Chinese government is able to implement the Great Firewall by requiring internet service providers and companies that operate websites and platforms to comply with their censorship policies, and by using technologies like VPN blocking to make it more difficult for people to access blocked content."],"11972":["Certainly!

This is because different parts of the engine and the car can start to wear out and become less efficient over time. Some common causes of increased noise and vibration in a car's engine include:\\n\\nWorn out or damaged engine mounts: The engine mounts are what hold the engine in place and help to absorb vibration. If the engine mounts become worn out or damaged, they may not be able to do their job as well, which can lead to more vibration and noise.\\n\\nWorn out or damaged engine bearings: The bearings in an engine help to support the moving parts and reduce friction. If the bearings become worn out or damaged, they may not be able to do their job as well, which can lead to more noise and vibration.\\n\\nWorn out or damaged spark plugs: Spark plugs are what ignite the fuel in the engine. If the spark plugs become worn out or damaged, they may not be able to do their job as well, which can lead to more noise and vibration.\\n\\nWorn out or damaged belts and pulleys: The belts and pulleys in a car's engine help to drive various parts of the engine. If they become worn out or damaged, they may not be able to do their job as well, which can lead to more noise and vibration.\\n\\nTo return a car's engine to its original condition, it may be necessary to replace some of the worn out or damaged parts. This can be done by a mechanic or someone with knowledge and experience working on car engines. It is important to regularly maintain and service a car to help prevent these issues from occurring or to catch them early before they become more serious problems."],"2742":["Neanderthals were ancient humans who lived in Europe and western Asia between about 200,000 and 40,000 years ago. They were very similar to modern humans in many ways, including their ability to communicate. It is likely that Neanderthals had some form of language, although it is difficult to know for sure because they left no written records. Scientists have found evidence that Neanderthals had a complex culture and were able to communicate with each other in some way. For example, they made tools, built shelters, and used fire, which all require some level of communication and cooperation. There is also evidence that Neanderthals may have had the ability to make and use complex vocalizations, similar to modern humans. Some scientists believe that they may have had a form of language that was similar to modern human languages, while others believe that their language may have been more limited. However, it is important to note that we cannot be certain about how Neanderthals communicated or what their language was like, as we do not have any direct evidence of their language. We can only make educated guesses based on the limited information we have about them."],"8587":["I'm sorry, but I am unable to view external images or browse the web, so I am unable to see the specific GIF you are referring to. Without more context, it is not possible for me to accurately explain how the image you have described might be a representation of the fourth dimension.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the fourth dimension can be difficult to understand, as it is beyond our everyday experience of the three dimensions of space that we are familiar with (length, width, and height). In mathematics and physics, the fourth dimension is often used as a way to describe additional properties or characteristics that cannot be represented in the three dimensions of space.\r\n\r\nOne way to think about the fourth dimension is as a kind of \"time-like\" dimension, which allows for the possibility of time travel or the existence of multiple parallel universes. Some scientists and philosophers have also suggested that the fourth dimension might be related to other concepts such as consciousness or the fundamental nature of reality.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the concept of the fourth dimension is purely theoretical and has not been directly observed or proven to exist. The image you described may be intended to be a visual representation of what the fourth dimension might look like, but it is ultimately a matter of interpretation and speculation."],"5098":["\\nThe Himalayas are a mountain range that was formed when the Indian plate collided with the Eurasian plate. The collision of these two plates caused the land to rise up and form the Himalayas.\\n\\nThe Indian plate is still moving and colliding with the Eurasian plate, and this process is what is responsible for the continued uplift of the Himalayas. The collision of the two plates is also responsible for the earthquakes that occur in the region.\\n\\nThe Indian plate will not disappear completely because of this collision. Instead, the collision will continue to push the Himalayas higher and higher over millions of years. The process of plate tectonics, which is the movement of the Earth's plates, is slow, and it takes a long time for the effects of the collision to be visible.\\n\\nSo, to answer your question, the Indian plate will not disappear, but it will continue to push against the Eurasian plate, and this will cause the Himalayas to continue to rise.\\n"],"8867":["Gerrymandering is the practice of redrawing voter district lines in a way that gives one political party an unfair advantage in elections. It is a controversial practice because it can be used to manipulate the outcome of elections and undermine the principle of fair representation.\r\n\r\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have been accused of gerrymandering in different parts of the country. Some people put up with it because they may feel that their party is more likely to win if the district lines are drawn in their favor. Others may not be aware that gerrymandering is happening, or they may not think that it is a big enough problem to worry about.\r\n\r\nGerrymandering is generally considered to be unfair and can contribute to political polarization and mistrust in the democratic process. It is important for people to be aware of gerrymandering and to advocate for fair and impartial redistricting processes to ensure that all voices are heard and that elections are fair and representative."],"6965":["There are several reasons why rape cases can be difficult to prosecute. One reason is that there is often a lack of physical evidence, such as DNA evidence, which can be helpful in proving that a rape occurred. Another reason is that rape cases often involve only two people: the victim and the perpetrator. This means that there may be no other witnesses to the crime, and it becomes the victim's word against the perpetrator's word.Additionally, some people may be skeptical of the victim's account of what happened, and may question the victim's actions or behaviors. This is known as victim blaming, and it can make it more difficult for the victim to speak out about the crime.Overall, prosecuting rape cases can be difficult because it often requires proving that the crime occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, which can be challenging in cases where there is little physical evidence and it is the victim's word against the perpetrator's."],"11328":["All forms of life that we know of on Earth require certain nutrients to survive. These nutrients include things like water, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and vitamins.

However, until we actually find another form of life, we can only speculate about what it might be like."],"9343":["A generation is a group of people who are born around the same time and experience the same cultural events. People who are born within a few years of each other are generally considered to be part of the same generation. For example, if you were born in the 1980s, you might be considered part of the \"Generation X\" group, while someone who was born in the 1990s might be considered part of the \"Millennial\" generation.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"Generation X\" and \"Millennial\" are just labels that are used to describe different groups of people based on when they were born. There isn't a strict definition of exactly when one generation ends and the next begins, so different sources might use slightly different dates to define these groups.\r\n\r\nAs for siblings, if one sibling is a few years older or younger than the other, they might still be considered part of the same generation. However, if there is a significant age gap between the siblings (for example, if one sibling was born in the 1970s and the other was born in the 1990s), they might be considered part of different generations."],"11697":["Mental torture and physical torture are both very harmful and can have serious consequences for a person's mental and physical health. It is difficult to compare the two because they can affect people in different ways and can be more or less severe depending on the individual and the situation.\r\n\r\nOne reason that mental torture may be considered worse than physical torture is because it can be harder to detect and stop. Mental torture often involves psychological manipulation and can be subtler than physical torture, which may make it more difficult for a victim to recognize and seek help. Mental torture can also be more enduring, as it can leave long-lasting psychological scars and can continue to affect a person even after the torture has stopped.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, mental torture can be especially cruel because it can exploit a person's deepest fears, insecurities, and vulnerabilities. It can cause a person to doubt their own thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, which can be extremely distressing and can undermine a person's sense of self.\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognize that both mental and physical torture are serious human rights violations that can have devastating consequences for those who experience them. No one should have to endure such treatment, and it is important to do everything we can to prevent and eliminate torture in all its forms."],"13754":["Elon Musk is the CEO of SpaceX, a company that designs and manufactures rockets and spacecraft.

In short, SpaceX makes money through the sale of its products and services."],"14677":["A flat tax, where everyone pays the same percentage of their earnings, can seem fair at first glance because it treats everyone equally. However, a flat tax can actually be unfair for several reasons:\n\nA flat tax disproportionately affects lower-income earners. For example, if the flat tax rate is 10%, someone who makes $20,000 per year would pay $2,000 in taxes, while someone who makes $200,000 per year would pay $20,000 in taxes. The person making $20,000 per year would have to pay a larger portion of their income in taxes compared to the person making $200,000 per year.\n\nA flat tax does not take into account differences in the cost of living. For example, someone who lives in an area with a high cost of living may have a lower income but still have to pay the same percentage of their income in taxes as someone who lives in an area with a lower cost of living.\n\nA flat tax does not provide incentives for certain types of behavior, such as saving or investing. Some countries use a progressive tax system, where people who earn more pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. This can encourage people to work and earn more, because they will keep a larger portion of their income.\n\nA flat tax can also be difficult to implement, as it requires a large administrative system to collect and enforce the tax.\n\nOverall, while a flat tax may seem simple and fair on the surface, it can actually be unfair and may not be the best way to tax people's income."],"13947":["Thorium is a potential fuel for nuclear power plants, and it has some advantages over the more commonly used uranium fuel. However, it is not currently in widespread use for a number of reasons. One reason is that thorium is not as energy-dense as uranium, so more of it is required to produce the same amount of electricity. This means that the fuel would be more expensive and there would be more waste to dispose of. Another reason is that it is more difficult to use thorium as a fuel in existing nuclear power plants. Most nuclear power plants are designed to use uranium as fuel, and it would be expensive and time-consuming to modify them to use thorium instead. Finally, there are also technical challenges associated with using thorium as a fuel. It is more difficult to control the nuclear reactions that take place when using thorium, and it is more difficult to dispose of the waste products that are produced. Overall, while thorium has some potential as a fuel for nuclear power, there are still many challenges that need to be overcome before it can be used more widely."],"14628":["There are a few benefits to having a diesel-powered vehicle instead of a gasoline-powered one. Diesel fuel is generally more efficient than gasoline, which means that a diesel engine can get more miles out of a gallon of fuel than a gasoline engine can. This means that you might be able to save money on fuel costs if you drive a diesel vehicle. Diesel engines also tend to last longer than gasoline engines, so you might be able to save money on maintenance and repairs in the long run. Finally, diesel engines can produce less greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline engines, so if you're concerned about the environment, a diesel vehicle might be a good choice for you."],"362":["Great question! An exclamation point is used to show that something is being said with emphasis or excitement, like yelling. There isn't a specific symbol that means whispering in the same way that an exclamation point means yelling. However, there are other ways to show that something is being whispered in writing. One way is to use quotation marks and put the words that are being whispered inside the quotation marks, like this: \"Don't tell anyone, but I saw a unicorn in the backyard!\" This can help to show that the words are being spoken softly or quietly. \nAnother way to show that something is being whispered is to use words or phrases that describe whispering, like \"in a whisper\" or \"under his breath.\" For example, \"He whispered the secret in a whisper, so no one else could hear.\" These words and phrases can help to give the reader a sense of how the words are being spoken. \nI hope this helps to answer your question!

This change in symptoms is thought to be due to the person's belief in the treatment and their expectation that it will work.\\n\\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with the placebo effect, and it can be a useful tool in research studies to help determine whether a treatment is truly effective or not. However, the placebo effect can also be problematic in certain situations.\\n\\nFor example, if a person is using a placebo instead of a treatment that has been proven to be effective, they may not be getting the best care for their condition. This can be especially problematic if the person has a serious or life-threatening illness, as they may not be receiving the treatment they need to get better.\\n\\nAdditionally, the placebo effect can sometimes be used as a way to sell products that do not actually work, such as certain types of alternative therapies or supplements. In these cases, people may spend money on these products and believe that they are receiving a benefit, even though there is no scientific evidence to support their effectiveness. This can be harmful, as people may be misled into thinking that they are getting a treatment that is actually helping them, when in fact it is not.\\n\\nOverall, the placebo effect can be a useful tool in research, but it is important to be cautious when using placebos as a treatment and to make sure that people are receiving the best care possible for their conditions."],"3497":["The wind is caused by differences in air pressure. When the air pressure is higher in one place than another, the air will try to move from the higher pressure area to the lower pressure area to even things out. This movement of air is what we feel as wind. Imagine that you have two balloons. One balloon is full of air, while the other balloon is empty. If you let go of the empty balloon, it will fly around the room because there is less air inside of it, and it will be trying to move towards the areas with more air. The same thing happens with the air in the atmosphere. When there is a difference in air pressure, the air will try to move from the area with higher pressure to the area with lower pressure. The wind can also be caused by the movement of the Earth and the way that the land, water, and air interact with each other. For example, when the sun warms up the land, it can cause the air above the land to rise, creating a low pressure area. This can cause the wind to blow from the surrounding areas, where the air is cooler and more dense, towards the low pressure area. I hope this helps to explain what causes the wind to blow! Let me know if you have any more questions."],"572":["When you are driving a manual transmission vehicle, the clutch is used to connect and disconnect the engine from the wheels. When you push the clutch pedal down, it disconnects the engine from the wheels, allowing you to change gears. \nWhen you are braking or coming to a stop, it's important to push the clutch down before you come to a complete stop. This is because if you leave the clutch engaged (not pressed down) while the car is stopped, it can cause the engine to stall. \nStalling the engine can be inconvenient and potentially dangerous, especially if you are driving in heavy traffic or on a busy road. By pushing the clutch down before you come to a stop, you can avoid stalling the engine and ensure a smooth stop. \nIt's also a good habit to get into because it can help you to smoothly shift into neutral when you come to a stop, rather than suddenly trying to find the right gear at the last minute. \nI hope this helps!

It is often much faster at this type of work than the computer's main processor, or CPU.\r\n\r\nWhen you reduce or disable certain graphical effects on your computer, it can help improve performance because it means that the GPU and CPU don't have to work as hard. For example, if you turn off the feature that makes windows transparent, it will use fewer resources and allow the GPU and CPU to work on other tasks.\r\n\r\nThink of it like having two people working on a project together. If one person is in charge of doing all the hard work and the other person is just standing around, it will be easier for them to finish the project quickly.

The main factor that determines the severity of a hangover is the amount of alcohol that you drink, not the price or quality of the alcohol. \nWhen you drink alcohol, your body has to process and metabolize it. This process takes time and can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms, including headache, nausea, and fatigue, which are commonly referred to as a hangover. The more alcohol you drink, the longer it takes for your body to process it, and the worse your hangover is likely to be. \nThere are other factors that can also contribute to the severity of a hangover, such as the type of alcohol you drink (darker drinks like red wine and whiskey may cause worse hangovers than lighter drinks like vodka or gin), your overall health and hydration level, and your individual tolerance to alcohol. \nSo, if you want to avoid a hangover, the best thing you can do is to drink in moderation and stay hydrated by drinking water or other non-alcoholic beverages. It's also a good idea to eat something while you're drinking, as food can help slow down the absorption of alcohol into your system."],"4090":["Comic book writers and artists use bold words to show that a character is speaking loudly or emphasizing a particular word or phrase.

Some scientists believe that it could be due to genetics, while others think that it might be influenced by environmental factors.One theory is that the preference for using one hand over the other is determined by the brain, and that this preference is influenced by genes that we inherit from our parents. It's possible that certain genes make it more likely for a person to be right-handed, while other genes make it more likely for a person to be left-handed.Another theory is that the way a person uses their hands is influenced by the way their brain develops in the womb. For example, some research suggests that the position of the baby in the womb or the amount of testosterone the baby is exposed to during development might affect whether a person becomes right- or left-handed.Overall, it's still not fully understood why some people are right-handed and others are left-handed, and more research is needed to figure out the exact causes."],"4306":["There are a few reasons why artists might still release singles, even though people can listen to individual songs on streaming services.\\n\\nOne reason is that releasing a single can help an artist build excitement for an upcoming album. A single is often the first new music an artist releases in a while, and it can get fans excited for more.\\n\\nAnother reason is that releasing a single can help an artist stay relevant and get their music in front of more people. If an artist releases a single, it can be featured on music charts and get played on the radio, which can help the artist gain new fans.\\n\\nFinally, releasing a single can also be a way for an artist to experiment with new sounds or styles. A single is a shorter format than an album, so it can be a good way for an artist to try out something new without committing to a full album's worth of material.\\n\\nOverall, releasing a single can be a way for an artist to get their music out to more people and build excitement for their work."],"8616":["Diesel cars generally cost more than gas cars for a few reasons. One reason is that diesel fuel is generally more expensive than regular gasoline. Diesel engines are also typically more expensive to manufacture than gasoline engines because they require more durable parts and are built to withstand higher compression ratios. Additionally, diesel cars often have better fuel efficiency than gas cars, which can save money on fuel costs in the long run, but this may not always offset the initial higher purchase price. Finally, diesel cars may require special equipment, such as diesel particulate filters, to reduce emissions, which can also increase the cost."],"5448":["\"Solar Freaking Roadways\" was a concept for building roads out of solar panels that could generate electricity from the sun. The idea was that these solar roads could help to generate clean energy and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.\\n\\nHowever, the concept faced a number of challenges and limitations that made it difficult to implement in practice. For example, solar panels are relatively fragile and would not be able to withstand the heavy weight and wear and tear of vehicles driving over them on a regular basis. Additionally, the cost of building solar roads would be significantly higher than traditional roads, and it would be difficult to justify the added expense when there are other, more cost-effective ways to generate solar energy.\\n\\nDespite the initial hype and excitement around the idea, \"Solar Freaking Roadways\" has not gained much traction and has largely been abandoned as a practical solution for generating clean energy. However, the concept has inspired other researchers and companies to explore alternative ways to harness the power of the sun and create clean energy solutions."],"1707":["In the United States, there are two main political parties: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. These parties have been around for many years and have different ideas and beliefs about how the government should operate and what policies it should implement. People often associate with one party or the other based on their own personal beliefs and values. For example, some people might align with the Democrats because they believe in more progressive policies such as healthcare reform and protecting the environment, while others might align with the Republicans because they believe in lower taxes and smaller government. There are certainly some issues that both parties can agree on, such as the importance of national security or the need to improve infrastructure. However, there are also many issues on which the two parties disagree, such as immigration, gun control, and social welfare programs. This can lead to disagreement and conflict between the parties. In short, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are two main political parties in the United States that have different ideas about how the government should operate and what policies it should implement. People often associate with one party or the other based on their own beliefs and values, and there can be disagreement and conflict between the parties on certain issues."],"7298":["When you watch a video, the images are being played back at a steady rate, so you see a smooth and consistent stream of images. When you play a game, the game is constantly updating and changing, and your computer or device has to work hard to keep up with all of these changes and render them on the screen. If your device is not able to keep up with the game, you may experience lag or other issues that can make the game feel less smooth.There are also other factors that can affect the smoothness of a game, such as the quality of your device, the strength of your internet connection, and the game's graphics settings. If you have a powerful device and a strong connection, and you've set the graphics settings to a level that your device can handle, you should be able to experience smooth gameplay.So, when you watch a 60 fps video, you see a smooth stream of images because the video is playing back at a steady rate. When you play a 60 fps game, the game may not always feel as smooth because your device has to work hard to keep up with all of the changes and updates in the game."],"13202":["A straw man fallacy is a type of argument where someone misrepresents or exaggerates an opponent's position, and then attacks this distorted version of the position instead of the real position. This fallacy is often used to make the opponent's position seem weaker or easier to attack than it really is. Here's an example of a straw man fallacy: Person A: \"I think we should recycle more to help protect the environment.\"\nPerson B: \"Oh, so you want us to turn the whole world into a giant recycling plant and never use any new materials again?\" Person B is using a straw man fallacy by exaggerating Person A's position and misrepresenting it as something much more extreme than it actually is. Person A simply thinks that recycling is a good thing to do to help protect the environment, but Person B makes it seem like Person A wants to completely stop using new materials, which is not what Person A said at all. I hope this helps!

They also might not have the same kind of overhead costs as the larger, more well-known companies. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the quality of off-brand batteries is worse. In some cases, off-brand batteries may actually be just as good as name-brand batteries, but they just cost less because the company that makes them doesn't have as many expenses. In other cases, the quality might not be as good, but you might be willing to take that risk if you're looking to save money."],"1182":["Pushing on your closed eyelids can give you weird visions because it can change the way light is entering your eye and how your brain is processing that light. When you close your eyes, your brain is still receiving signals from the light-sensitive cells in your retina, even though it's dark. When you press on your eyelids, you can change the way that light is entering your eye and how your brain is interpreting that light. This can cause your brain to create strange or surreal images. \nIt's also possible that the act of pressing on your eyelids can cause your brain to release chemicals that can affect your perception or cause you to have hallucinations. This is a normal, harmless phenomenon that can happen to anyone. It's not something to be worried about, and it's not related to any underlying health problems."],"13935":["It's not clear exactly why shaking hands with the right hand became a common practice, but it is likely because most people are right-handed and therefore it is more convenient to use their right hand. Another possibility is that shaking hands with the right hand dates back to ancient times when people used their left hand for hygiene purposes, so shaking hands with the right hand was a way to show that you weren't holding a weapon. Whatever the reason, shaking hands with the right hand has become a widely accepted way to greet people and show goodwill in many cultures around the world."],"386":["Sure! When we listen to music, we can hear different sounds made by different instruments. Each instrument makes a sound that is unique to that instrument, and we can tell them apart based on the way they sound. \nFor example, when you play an \"A\" note on a cello, it will sound different from when you play an \"A\" note on a piano. This is because the cello and the piano are different instruments, and they produce sound in different ways. \nThe cello uses strings that are played with a bow, and the strings vibrate to create sound. The piano uses strings that are struck by hammers when you press a key, and the strings vibrate to create sound. Because the cello and the piano use different methods to produce sound, the \"A\" notes they play will sound different. \nThe pitch of a note refers to how high or low it sounds. An \"A\" note on a cello and an \"A\" note on a piano will have the same pitch, but they will sound different because of the way the instruments produce sound. \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"13002":["Proprietary software is software that is owned by a company or individual and is not available for users to freely modify or distribute. This means that users are often required to pay for a license to use the software and are not allowed to make copies of it or share it with others. Some people see proprietary software as \"bad\" or \"evil\" because they believe that software should be freely available to everyone, and that people should have the freedom to modify and distribute it as they see fit. This belief is based on the idea that software is a form of expression and communication, and that everyone should have access to it in order to be able to participate fully in society. Others argue that software development takes a lot of time, effort, and resources, and that companies and individuals who create software should be able to charge for it in order to recoup their costs and make a profit. They may also argue that proprietary software can provide users with more features, support, and security than free software, and that it is therefore worth paying for. Ultimately, the debate over proprietary versus free software is a complex and ongoing one, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Some people may see proprietary software as \"bad\" or \"evil,\" while others may see it as a necessary and beneficial part of the software ecosystem."],"2304":["Both a $10 HDMI cable and a $100 HDMI cable are designed to transmit an HDMI signal from one device to another, such as from a cable box to a television. The main difference between the two cables is the materials and construction used to make them. The $10 HDMI cable is likely made with cheaper materials and may not be as durable or well-constructed as the $100 HDMI cable. It may also use lower-quality connectors and may not be as resistant to interference from other electronic devices. On the other hand, the $100 HDMI cable is likely made with higher-quality materials and is better constructed. It may also use higher-quality connectors and be more resistant to interference. However, in most cases, the difference in performance between a $10 HDMI cable and a $100 HDMI cable is minimal. In other words, both cables should be able to transmit an HDMI signal with similar quality, and you may not notice much difference in the picture or sound when using one or the other. It's worth noting that there are some cases where a higher-quality HDMI cable can make a difference, such as when using a longer cable or when connecting devices that support higher resolutions or refresh rates. However, in most cases, a standard HDMI cable should be sufficient for most people's needs."],"2518":["Triglycerides are a type of fat that is found in your blood. They are made up of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule. Triglycerides are an important source of energy for your body, but it's important to have them at healthy levels. If you have high levels of triglycerides in your blood, it can increase your risk for certain health problems. High triglycerides can increase your risk for heart disease and stroke, as well as other problems such as pancreatitis and fatty liver disease. There are several things that can contribute to high triglycerides, such as eating too much sugar and unhealthy fats, not getting enough exercise, and being overweight. If you have high triglycerides, your doctor may recommend making lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthier diet and getting more exercise, to help lower your triglyceride levels. They may also prescribe medication to help lower your triglycerides if needed. It's important to work with your doctor to keep your triglyceride levels within a healthy range. This can help you reduce your risk for health problems and live a healthier life."],"8452":["A migraine is a type of headache that can cause severe pain, often on one side of the head. It can also cause other symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound.\r\n\r\nThe cause of migraines is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to changes in the brain and the blood vessels in the head. Some people get migraines when they are under stress or when they are exposed to certain triggers, like bright lights, strong smells, or certain foods.\r\n\r\nDuring a migraine, the blood vessels in the head may constrict (narrow) and then expand (widen). This can cause the blood flow to the brain to change, which may cause the headache and other symptoms.\r\n\r\nMigraines can be treated with medications and other therapies. It is important to talk to a doctor if you get migraines frequently or if they are severe and interfere with your daily activities."],"4118":["Sound is actually a type of vibration that travels through the air as a wave. In order for sound to be heard, there needs to be something for the sound waves to travel through, like air or water. In the vacuum of space, there is no air, so there is nothing for sound waves to travel through. This is why you can't hear sound in space. However, spacecraft like Voyager can still capture sound using special instruments called microphones. These instruments are able to pick up vibrations and turn them into electric signals, which can then be recorded and played back as sound. This is how scientists are able to study the sounds of things like thunder and lightning on other planets, even though there is no air in space for the sound to travel through."],"4287":["Lorem Ipsum is a placeholder text that is often used in the printing and publishing industry. It is used as a way to fill in the space on a page with text, so that designers and printers can see how the final layout of a document will look.\\n\\nImagine you are designing a book or a brochure. You need to know how much space the text will take up on each page, and you need to know how the text will look when it is printed. Instead of using real words and sentences, you can use Lorem Ipsum. This way, you can focus on the design of the document without getting distracted by the content of the text.\\n\\nLorem Ipsum is not a real language. It is made up of Latin words and phrases that are scrambled together to create a random, nonsensical text. This makes it easier for designers to focus on the layout and design of the document, rather than getting caught up in the meaning of the words.\\n\\nSo, in short, Lorem Ipsum is used as a way to fill in space with placeholder text, so that designers and printers can see how the final layout of a document will look."],"2456":["Determining if a planet hundreds of light years away may support life is a difficult task for scientists because it is not possible for us to go to these planets and directly observe them. However, scientists can use telescopes and other instruments to gather information about these distant planets and use this information to try to understand if the planet might be suitable for life. One way that scientists can study distant planets is by looking at the light that is reflected off the planet's surface. By analyzing this light, scientists can learn about the composition of the planet's atmosphere, which can give them clues about whether the planet might have conditions that are suitable for life. Another way that scientists can study distant planets is by looking for signs of water. Water is essential for life as we know it, and if a planet has water, it is more likely to be able to support life. Scientists can look for water on distant planets by looking for certain chemicals in the planet's atmosphere or by studying the planet's temperature to see if it is within the range that would allow water to exist in liquid form. Overall, determining if a distant planet may support life is a challenging task that requires scientists to carefully study the planet and use their knowledge about the conditions that are necessary for life to make educated guesses about whether the planet could be suitable for life."],"12904":["Sure, I can try to explain the twin paradox to you in a way that is easy to understand! Imagine that you have two twins, and one of them (we'll call her Twin A) stays on Earth while the other one (Twin B) gets on a spaceship and travels very, very fast through space. While Twin B is flying through space, time will pass more slowly for her than it does for Twin A, who is still on Earth. This means that when Twin B comes back to Earth, she will have aged less than Twin A. The reason this happens is because time and space are connected in strange ways that we don't fully understand. When an object moves very fast, it can cause time to slow down around it. So, even though the same amount of time passes on Earth and on the spaceship, the time on the spaceship seems to go by more slowly. I hope that helps to explain the twin paradox to you! Let me know if you have any more questions."],"4290":["Pilots who experience high levels of G-forces, or gravitational forces, may lose consciousness if the forces acting on their body are too strong. When a person is subjected to high G-forces, the blood in their body is pulled towards the lower part of their body, away from their head. This can cause a decrease in blood flow to the brain, leading to a loss of consciousness.\\n\\nAs the blood is pulled away from the head, it can cause the face to appear \"disfigured,\" or distorted. This is because the muscles in the face may become tense and strained as the person struggles to maintain consciousness. The face may also appear pale or flushed due to the change in blood flow.\\n\\nIt's important to note that G-forces can be dangerous and pilots undergo special training to learn how to handle them safely."],"3164":["Bose-Einstein condensation is a phenomenon that happens to a group of particles at extremely low temperatures. These particles, called bosons, are attracted to each other and start to behave like a single entity instead of individual particles. Imagine you have a bunch of balls that you want to put in a box. If the balls are big and there is a lot of space in the box, you can easily put them in and they will stay separate from each other. But if the balls are very small and the box is very small, they will start to squish together and act as a single ball. That's kind of what happens with Bose-Einstein condensation. When the temperature of a group of bosons is lowered to a very low level, they start to act like a single entity. This can have some strange effects, like the particles being able to flow through solid objects and the particles being able to exist in multiple places at the same time. Bose-Einstein condensation is still a bit of a mystery to scientists, and they are continuing to study it to learn more about how it works."],"15975":["PDF stands for Portable Document Format. It is a type of file that is used to store documents and is often used to share documents because it looks the same on any device. PDFs are small because they use a special type of compression to make the file size smaller without changing the quality of the content. This means that you can send a PDF via email or upload it to the internet without it taking up too much space.\n\nPDFs can contain a lot of pictures and text because they are designed to be a digital version of a paper document. You can include any information that you would put in a paper document, such as text, images, and tables.\n\nPDFs can be secure because they can be password protected, which means that only people with the correct password can open and view the PDF. Additionally, PDFs can be signed digitally, which allows you to prove that the PDF has not been altered since it was signed.\n\nPDFs are not connected with Flash. Flash is a type of software that was used to create animations and interactive content for websites, but it is no longer widely used.

This can cause a person to experience changes in their behavior, movements, or feelings. Seizures can have many different causes, including certain medical conditions, medications, or injuries to the brain.\r\n\r\nDuring a seizure, the person may lose consciousness or be unable to speak or move normally. They might also have strange sensations, such as feeling tingling or numbness, seeing flashing lights, or hearing strange noises. Some people might only have a brief period of strange behavior, while others might have longer seizures that involve convulsions or muscle spasms.\r\n\r\nSeizures can be scary for the person having them and for people who are watching, but most seizures do not cause any lasting harm. If someone is having a seizure, it's important to stay calm and try to protect them from injury. If the seizure lasts for a long time or the person is having trouble breathing, it's important to get medical help right away."],"15075":["The polar ice caps are made up of ice that is sitting on top of land, rather than floating in the ocean. When this ice melts, it flows into the ocean and increases the amount of water in the ocean, causing the sea level to rise.\n\nImagine you have a glass of water with some ice cubes floating in it. If you leave the glass out and the ice melts, the water level in the glass will rise. That's because the ice is taking up space in the glass, and as it melts, it becomes water, which takes up more space. The same thing happens when the polar ice caps melt and the water flows into the ocean. The extra water increases the volume of the ocean, which causes the sea level to rise.\n\nSo the movie \"Waterworld\" was not entirely accurate, because it depicted the polar ice caps melting and causing the entire world to be covered in water. In reality, the sea level would rise, but it would not cover the entire world."],"15069":["There are a number of conspiracy theories surrounding the events of September 11, 2001, also known as 9\/11, which is the day that terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington D.C., and a field in Pennsylvania. Many of these conspiracy theories claim that the attacks were not carried out by terrorists, but were actually planned and carried out by the United States government or other powerful organizations.\n\nOne of the main arguments made by those who believe in 9\/11 cover-up conspiracy theories is that the collapse of the World Trade Center towers was not caused by the impact of the airplanes and the resulting fires, but was actually the result of a controlled demolition. However, there is no evidence to support this theory and it has been debunked by numerous experts. The collapse of the towers was investigated by a number of organizations, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which concluded that the towers collapsed due to the combined effects of the impact of the airplanes and the fires that resulted from the crash.\n\nAnother common argument made by those who believe in 9\/11 cover-up conspiracy theories is that the attacks were not carried out by terrorists, but were actually an inside job carried out by the U.S. government or other powerful organizations. However, there is no credible evidence to support this theory, and it has been thoroughly debunked by multiple investigations, including the 9\/11 Commission Report, which was conducted by a bipartisan panel of experts and found that the attacks were planned and carried out by a group of terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda.\n\nIt's important to remember that conspiracy theories are not based on evidence and can often be harmful, as they can spread misinformation and cause people to mistrust legitimate sources of information. It's always important to carefully evaluate the evidence and consider multiple sources before coming to any conclusions about a complex event like 9\/11."],"12423":["French fries and other fried foods can taste awful when reheated because the process of frying causes the water in the food to evaporate, leaving behind the starch and protein. When you heat up the fries again, the moisture that was lost during the initial frying process never returns, leaving the fries dry and tasteless. Pizza, on the other hand, is often made with a sauce and cheese that helps to keep the crust moist, so it tends to hold up better when reheated. Rice, mac and cheese, and other foods that don't reheat well tend to suffer from the same problem as fries - they lose moisture when they are cooked, and when they are reheated, they can become dry and lose their flavor. To help these foods taste better when they are reheated, it can be helpful to add a little bit of moisture back in. For example, you can add a little bit of water or broth to rice when you are reheating it, or you can put a slice of cheese on top of your pizza before you heat it up to help keep it moist."],"8199":["Car batteries are designed to provide a steady source of power to the car's electrical systems. They are able to do this because they are able to store a lot of energy in the form of chemical reactions that can be easily converted into electricity.\r\n\r\nWhen you start your car, the battery provides a burst of power to the starter motor, which turns over the engine and gets it running. Once the engine is running, the alternator takes over and provides power to the car's electrical systems.\r\n\r\nThe alternator is a device that uses the movement of the engine to generate electricity, and it is able to generate much more power than the battery alone. This means that even though the car requires a lot of power to run, the battery is only used for a short period of time and then the alternator takes over and provides the majority of the power needed.\r\n\r\nThe battery is able to last a long time because it is only called upon to provide a burst of power when the car is started, and then the alternator takes over and provides power for the rest of the time the car is running.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to explain why car batteries are able to last a long time even though cars require a lot of power!

It is based on the idea that substances that can cause certain symptoms in a healthy person can also be used to treat those same symptoms in a person who is sick. Here's how it's supposed to work: A person with a particular health problem is given a very small amount of a substance that is believed to cause similar symptoms in a healthy person. The idea is that this small amount of the substance will stimulate the person's own healing response and help their body to get better. The substances used in homeopathy are often plant, mineral, or animal-based, and are typically diluted many times over in water or alcohol. Some people believe that the more a substance is diluted, the more powerful it becomes. Homeopathic remedies are usually taken in the form of pills or drops. Homeopathy is based on the belief that the body has the ability to heal itself, and that by using very small amounts of certain substances, it can be helped to do so. However, there is little scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies. Many mainstream medical organizations, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO), have concluded that there is no scientific basis for the effectiveness of homeopathy."],"15892":["An economy can \"crash\" when there is a sudden and significant decrease in the value of goods, services, and investments. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as:\n\nA recession: A recession is a period of economic downturn, during which there is a decrease in economic activity and employment. Recessions can be caused by a variety of factors, including a decrease in consumer spending, an increase in taxes or interest rates, or a decrease in exports.\n\nA financial crisis: A financial crisis is a situation in which the financial system of a country or the world is under stress. Financial crises can be caused by a variety of factors, including a bubble in asset prices (such as housing or stocks), a lack of confidence in financial institutions, or a sudden increase in the cost of borrowing money.\n\nA stock market crash: A stock market crash is a sudden and significant decrease in the value of stocks. Stock market crashes can be caused by a variety of factors, including a decrease in the overall value of a company's assets, a decrease in the demand for a company's products or services, or an increase in the supply of stocks.\n\nPolitical instability: Political instability, such as war, terrorism, or civil unrest, can also contribute to an economic crash. These events can disrupt trade and investment, leading to a decrease in economic activity.\n\nIt's important to note that an economy can also experience a slowdown or recession without experiencing a full-blown crash. A slowdown is a period of slower economic growth, while a recession is a more severe downturn."],"733":["There are a variety of reasons why some Cuban Americans may not want the United States to normalize relations with Cuba. \nOne reason may be because they disagree with the political system in Cuba and the actions of the Cuban government. They may believe that normalizing relations would give the Cuban government legitimacy and support their rule. \nAnother reason may be because they or their family members have experienced negative consequences as a result of the Cuban government's actions. For example, they may have been imprisoned or had their property taken away by the government. They may feel that normalizing relations would be a betrayal to those who have suffered under the Cuban government. \nIt's also possible that some Cuban Americans may simply prefer to maintain the existing policy, even if it means limited relations with Cuba. They may feel a strong connection to their Cuban heritage and want to maintain a sense of separation from the Cuban government. \nOverall, the opinions of Cuban Americans on the matter of normalizing relations with Cuba can vary widely and are influenced by a variety of factors, including personal experiences, political beliefs, and cultural connections."],"14546":["When you press down on the clutch pedal in a car with a manual transmission, it disconnects the engine from the transmission. This is necessary because the gears in the transmission need to be stopped from turning in order to change gears. Imagine the engine and transmission are two separate machines that are connected by a clutch. When you press down on the clutch pedal, it's like you're pulling a lever that separates the two machines. This allows you to shift the gears in the transmission without the engine trying to turn them. Once you've shifted gears and released the clutch pedal, the engine and transmission are reconnected, and the car can move again. The clutch is an important part of the car's transmission system because it allows you to smoothly change gears while driving."],"11534":["The bail system in the United States is a way for people who have been arrested and charged with a crime to get out of jail while they wait for their trial. When someone is arrested, a judge will decide how much money they have to pay in order to get out of jail. This is called bail. If the person pays the bail, they can go home and wait for their trial. If they show up to all their court dates, they will get their bail money back. If they don't show up to court, they can lose their bail money. If the person is found guilty of the crime they were charged with, they will not get their bail money back. If they are found innocent, they will get their bail money back.

When you use a cane, you hold it in the hand on the same side as your injured leg or weak leg. The cane then helps to support some of your weight and take the pressure off of your injured leg. This can make it easier for you to walk and move around.When you walk normally, your weight is distributed evenly between both legs. However, if you have an injury or weakness in one leg, it can be harder to balance and distribute your weight evenly. This is where the cane comes in. By holding the cane in your hand on the opposite side of your injured leg, you can shift some of your weight onto the cane and off of your injured leg. This can make it easier for you to walk and move around without as much pain or discomfort."],"13649":["The CALM Act (short for Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act) is a law that was passed in the United States in 2010 to address the issue of loud commercials. The law requires that the volume of commercials be the same as the volume of the program they appear in, so that viewers aren't startled or annoyed by sudden increases in volume. The CALM Act has had some success in reducing the volume of commercials, but it is not a perfect solution. There are a few reasons why commercials might still seem louder than the programs they appear in: 1. Some commercials are still produced at higher volumes than programs, even though the CALM Act requires that they be the same volume. This might be because the people who produce the commercials don't follow the rules, or because the tools they use to measure volume are not accurate. 2. The volume of a commercial can also be affected by the TV or device you are using to watch it. If your TV or device has a setting that allows you to adjust the volume of the program and commercials separately, you might need to adjust the settings to make sure that the volume is consistent. 3. Finally, it is possible that some commercials are louder because they are trying to grab your attention. Even though the CALM Act requires that commercials be the same volume as the program, advertisers are still allowed to use other techniques (such as bright colors, fast-paced music, or flashy graphics) to make their ads more attention-getting. Overall, the CALM Act has helped to reduce the volume of commercials, but it is not a perfect solution. If you are still experiencing problems with loud commercials, you might need to adjust your TV or device settings, or try using a volume-leveling tool to smooth out the volume changes between programs and commercials."],"4985":["Altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness (AMS), is a condition that can occur when you are at high altitudes, typically above 8,000 feet (2,400 meters). At these altitudes, the air is thinner and contains less oxygen, which can cause problems for some people.\\n\\nBreathing more is not enough to combat AMS because it is not just a matter of getting more oxygen into your body. The amount of oxygen that your body can use is also limited by the amount of hemoglobin, a protein in your red blood cells, that is available to carry oxygen to your cells.\\n\\nAt high altitudes, the air is thinner and there is less oxygen available, so your body must work harder to get enough oxygen to your cells. This can cause your heart to beat faster and your breathing to become more shallow, which can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, headache, and fatigue.\\n\\nIn order to prevent or treat AMS, it is important to acclimatize to the high altitude slowly by ascending gradually and allowing your body time to adjust. Drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding alcohol and tobacco can also help. In severe cases, medications such as acetazolamide may be used to help your body adjust to the high altitude."],"7806":["Intuition is a way of knowing or understanding something without needing to think about it or use logical reasoning. It's often described as a gut feeling or a hunch. Scientists are still trying to understand exactly how intuition works, but some research suggests that it may involve the unconscious mind processing information and making quick decisions based on that information. This can be helpful in certain situations because it allows us to make quick decisions without needing to carefully analyze all of the available information. However, intuition can also lead us astray if we rely on it too much or if the unconscious mind has been influenced by biases or inaccurate information."],"170":["Online videos and GIFs are two different types of media that are loaded and played differently on your computer. \nVideos are usually streamed from a server to your computer, which means that your computer receives small pieces of the video at a time, and it plays them one after the other. This allows you to start watching the video almost immediately, even if the entire video has not yet been downloaded to your computer. \nGIFs, on the other hand, are usually loaded all at once, just like a regular image. This means that if the GIF is large or has a lot of frames (the \"pictures\" that make up the GIF), it can take longer to load. \nSo, the reason why videos stream smoothly on your computer and GIFs might seem to load slowly is because of the way they are loaded and played. Videos are streamed in small pieces, while GIFs are loaded all at once."],"8060":["In movies and TV shows, filmmakers use a technique called \"aging makeup\" to make actors look older. This can be done in a number of ways, such as using makeup to add wrinkles, grey hairs, and other signs of aging to an actor's face and hair. They may also use special effects, such as computer-generated imagery (CGI), to make an actor's face or body look older on screen. This allows filmmakers to show characters at different ages without having to find actors who physically look that age, or without having to wait for the actors to age naturally."],"4356":["In music, the beat is the basic unit of time, and the number of beats per measure is the time signature. The time signature tells us how many beats are in each measure, and what kind of note gets one beat.\\n\\n4 beats per measure is very common in music because it is a simple and easy to understand time signature. It is also very flexible, because it allows for a variety of rhythms and melodies to be played within the same basic structure.\\n\\n3 beats per measure is also common in music, especially in certain styles such as waltz or tango. Similarly, 6 beats per measure is often used in music with a fast tempo, such as in certain types of jazz or rock music.\\n\\n5 beats per measure is not as common as 4 or 3, but it is still used in some types of music. It can be found in certain styles of folk music or in some modern compositions.\\n\\nOverall, the choice of time signature depends on the style and feel of the music being played. Different time signatures can create different moods and atmospheres, and composers and musicians choose the time signature that best fits the music they want to create."],"1711":["Sure! A citizen's arrest is when a person who is not a law enforcement officer tries to detain someone they believe has committed a crime. Here's how it works: The person who wants to make a citizen's arrest must see the crime being committed or have good reason to believe that the person they want to arrest has committed a crime. The person making the arrest must tell the person they are arresting that they are being arrested and the reason why. The person making the arrest must then call the police and wait with the person they have arrested until the police arrive. It's important to note that making a citizen's arrest can be dangerous and should only be done in extreme situations where it is necessary to protect people or property. It is always best to call the police and let them handle the situation."],"5349":["\\nWhen a file becomes corrupted, it means that some of the data in the file has become damaged or lost. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as a power outage, a virus, or a problem with the computer or storage device the file is on.\\n\\nThere are a few different ways to try to repair a corrupted file. One way is to use a tool like WinRAR's archive repair tool. This tool looks at the corrupted file and tries to figure out what the original, uncorrupted version of the file should look like. It does this by looking at the parts of the file that are still intact and using that information to fill in the missing or damaged parts.\\n\\nThe success of this process depends on how much of the file is still intact. If there is a lot of the file that is still undamaged, the repair tool may be able to successfully restore the file to its original state. However, if the file is severely damaged, it may not be possible to repair it completely.\\n\\nIn general, using a repair tool like this can be helpful, but it is not always reliable. It is always a good idea to make backups of important files so that you have a copy to use in case the original becomes damaged or lost."],"11515":["Sometimes, when we are feeling stressed or overwhelmed, it can be nice to take a break and just relax our minds.

Going to college can help people learn a lot of things that can be useful in their careers, and it can also help them meet new people and have new experiences. Graduate school is like going to college, but for a longer time and usually for a more specific subject. Some people go to graduate school because they want to become experts in their field, or because they want to make more money."],"16991":["Medical marijuana is a form of treatment that uses the whole, unprocessed marijuana plant or its basic extracts to treat a variety of symptoms and conditions. While there is some evidence to suggest that marijuana may be effective in treating certain medical conditions, the use of marijuana as a medicine is still a topic of debate and is not fully understood by researchers.\n\nOne reason why medical marijuana has not been commercialized by the pharmaceutical industry is because the process of turning a plant into a medication is complex and time-consuming. This process involves isolating the active ingredients in the plant, testing them in laboratory and animal studies to determine their safety and effectiveness, and then conducting large-scale clinical trials to test the treatment in humans. This process can take many years and is expensive.\n\nAnother reason is that marijuana is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which means that it is illegal under federal law. This classification is based on the DEA's determination that marijuana has a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use. As a result, research on the medical use of marijuana is heavily regulated and can be difficult to conduct.\n\nThere are some pharmaceutical companies that are working on developing medications that contain active ingredients found in marijuana, but these medications are not the same as medical marijuana and are subject to the same regulatory approval process as any other medication."],"5457":["In a communist country, the government is responsible for organizing and managing the economy. This means that the government decides how work should be divided and how resources should be used.\\n\\nIn a communist system, the idea is that everyone works together for the good of the community, rather than just for their own benefit. So, people are expected to contribute to the economy by working and producing goods or providing services that are needed by the community.\\n\\nIf someone decides not to work, it could have negative consequences for the community. For example, if everyone stopped working, then there would be no one to produce goods or provide services, and the community would not be able to function properly.\\n\\nHowever, in a communist system, the government is also responsible for providing for the needs of all its citizens, including those who are unable to work due to age, illness, or disability. So, if someone is unable to work, they may still be able to receive support from the government to help meet their basic needs."],"11665":["The Aztecs, Mayans, and other Native American groups did indeed have diseases that were foreign and deadly to the Europeans. However, the Europeans had developed some immunity to many of these diseases due to previous exposure, so they were not affected as severely as the Native Americans were. On the other hand, the Native Americans had never been exposed to many of the diseases that the Europeans brought with them, so their bodies had no immunity and the diseases were able to spread quickly and kill many people. This is known as \"virgin soil epidemics.\""],"8853":["When you eat a big meal, your body has to work hard to digest all the food you've consumed. This process uses a lot of energy, and it can make you feel tired.\r\n\r\nYour body also has to direct blood flow to your digestive system to help with digestion, which can make you feel sluggish or tired. Additionally, some foods, especially those that are high in sugar or fat, can cause your blood sugar levels to spike and then crash, which can also make you feel tired.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that you might feel tired after eating a big meal because you're full and comfortable, and your body naturally wants to rest.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's normal to feel tired after eating a big meal, especially if you've eaten a lot of food or if the meal was high in sugar or fat. Just try to get some rest and give your body time to digest the food before getting back to your usual activities."],"13050":["There are time restrictions on the sale of alcohol in many places because alcohol can be harmful if consumed in excess. These time restrictions are put in place to try to reduce the chances of people drinking too much and causing problems, such as getting into fights or driving while intoxicated. It is also thought that time restrictions can help to reduce the number of young people who might be able to purchase alcohol, as they are less likely to be out and about late at night when the restrictions are in place. So, the time restrictions are put in place to help keep people safe and reduce the chances of problems occurring because of alcohol consumption."],"16227":["Tim Tebow was a successful college quarterback and won the Heisman Trophy, which is awarded to the best college football player in the United States. However, when he entered the NFL, he struggled to find success as a starting quarterback. There are a few reasons for this.\n\nOne reason is that the level of competition in the NFL is much higher than in college. In the NFL, all of the players are professional athletes who have been playing football for many years, and the defenses are much stronger and more complex. This can be a difficult transition for any player, and it was especially challenging for Tebow.\n\nAnother reason is that Tebow's throwing mechanics were not considered ideal for the NFL. Quarterbacks in the NFL need to be able to throw the ball accurately and with a lot of velocity, and Tebow's throwing motion was not considered to be as smooth or polished as some other quarterbacks. This made it harder for him to complete passes and be successful in the NFL.\n\nFinally, there are many other talented quarterbacks in the NFL, and it can be difficult for any player to stand out and earn a starting job. Even if a player has all of the right skills and qualities, they still need to have the opportunity to play and prove themselves on the field. Unfortunately, Tebow did not have many opportunities to be a starting quarterback in the NFL, and he was not able to consistently perform at a high level when he did get those opportunities."],"8716":["Westboro Baptist Church is a group of people who believe that God is punishing the United States for its sins, particularly for tolerating homosexuality. They believe that God is using tragedies, such as the deaths of soldiers, to send a message to the country. They protest at the funerals of soldiers to try to spread their message and to try to get people to change their behavior.\r\n\r\nSome people might find the Westboro Baptist Church's beliefs and actions to be offensive, but in the United States, people have the right to express their beliefs, even if those beliefs are unpopular or offensive to others. This is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees the freedom of speech and the freedom to practice any religion.\r\n\r\nWhile it is understandable that people might want to do something to stop the Westboro Baptist Church from protesting at soldiers' funerals, it is not appropriate or legal to try to eradicate a group just because we disagree with their beliefs. Instead, it is important to respect the rights of others, even if we strongly disagree with them, and to use peaceful means to try to address conflicts and differences of opinion."],"2657":["Medicare is a government-run health insurance program in the United States that provides coverage to people who are 65 years of age or older, as well as to some younger people with disabilities. It is funded through a combination of taxes and premiums paid by beneficiaries. There are a few reasons why Medicare cannot simply be made into an insurance option for everyone. One reason is that Medicare is currently funded through a mix of taxes and premiums, and it is not clear how this funding structure would work if everyone were allowed to enroll in the program. Additionally, Medicare is designed specifically for people who are 65 or older, and it may not have the capacity to cover everyone in the country. Another reason is that many people in the United States already have private health insurance through their employer or on their own. Some people may not want to switch to Medicare, even if it were available as an option. Finally, making Medicare available to everyone would be a significant change to the healthcare system in the United States, and there are likely to be different opinions on whether this is a good idea or not."],"5853":["Buses are not designed to be aerodynamic because they are not meant to go very fast. They are designed to carry a lot of people from one place to another, and the shape of the bus does not have a big impact on how well it does this job. Aerodynamic shapes can help vehicles go faster by reducing the amount of air resistance they face, but since buses are not meant to go fast, there is no need for them to be aerodynamic. Some buses are designed with more aerodynamic shapes in order to use less fuel and reduce their environmental impact, but this is not a requirement for all buses."],"8008":["It's actually more practical for castle gates to open inwards rather than outwards.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that if the gates opened outwards, they would be pushed against by the weight of the people trying to get inside the castle. This would make it harder to open the gates, and it would also put a lot of strain on the hinges.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that if the gates opened outwards, attackers could easily put a ram or another heavy object against them to try to break them down. If the gates opened inwards, however, it would be much harder for attackers to do this because they would have to push the gates open rather than pulling them open.\r\n\r\nFinally, castle gates that opened inwards allowed for an extra layer of protection for the people inside the castle. When the gates were closed, there would be a heavy bar or bolt that could be put in place to keep the gates securely shut. If the gates opened outwards, it would be easier for attackers to try to break the bar or bolt, but if the gates opened inwards, it would be much harder for them to do so.\r\n\r\nSo overall, it makes more sense for castle gates to open inwards because it's easier to open them, harder for attackers to break them down, and provides an extra layer of protection for the people inside the castle."],"7231":["Some websites use what are called \"query parameters\" in their URLs to pass information to the server that hosts the website. Query parameters are added to the end of a URL and are usually preceded by a question mark (?). They can be used to specify certain preferences or options, or to pass information to the server that the server needs in order to return the right content to the user.For example, imagine you are visiting a website that allows you to search for products. The website might have a search box where you can enter a keyword or phrase, and then the website will display a list of products that match your search. When you submit the search, the website might use a query parameter in the URL to pass the search keyword to the server. The server will then use that keyword to find and return the relevant products to the user.In the example you provided, \"URL_0?s=t\", the \"s\" and \"t\" are query parameters.

Skeletal muscles are used for movement and can get tired because they need to be able to contract and relax repeatedly, which requires energy. Cardiac muscle does not need to be able to relax and contract repeatedly in the same way, so it does not get tired in the same way. Additionally, the body has other types of muscle, such as smooth muscle, which is found in the walls of organs like the stomach and blood vessels. Each type of muscle has a specific function and is well-suited to performing that function."],"7225":["Anti-gravity flights, also known as zero gravity flights, do not actually involve the cancellation of gravity. Instead, they create the sensation of weightlessness by following a specific flight path that allows objects inside the aircraft to float freely as if they were in a state of zero gravity.Here's how it works: the aircraft follows a parabolic flight path, which involves climbing upwards at a steep angle and then falling back down towards the Earth in a controlled descent. During the ascent, the passengers inside the aircraft experience a feeling of weightlessness, as the force of gravity is temporarily reduced. This happens because the aircraft is accelerating upwards at a rate that is equal to the force of gravity, so the passengers feel weightless.As the aircraft reaches the top of its ascent and begins to descend, the passengers again experience a feeling of weightlessness. This time, the sensation is caused by the force of gravity pulling the passengers downward, while the aircraft is falling at the same rate.To maintain this sensation of weightlessness safely, the pilots of the aircraft carefully control the flight path and the acceleration of the aircraft. They also ensure that the passengers are properly secured in their seats and follow specific safety procedures to prevent injuries.Overall, anti-gravity flights are a fun and unique way to experience the sensation of weightlessness, but they do not actually involve the cancellation of gravity."],"2152":["Japanese-style toilets with built-in bidets and seat warmers are not as common in North America as they are in some other parts of the world, such as Japan and Europe. This is because different countries and cultures have different preferences and standards for their toilets.

Ultimately, it's up to individuals and companies to decide what types of toilets they want to use and sell."],"6928":["Yes, you could suffer from a form of \"space lag\" when traveling in a spaceship. This is because traveling through space, especially over long distances, can disrupt your body's natural rhythms and cause fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and other symptoms similar to jet lag.Jet lag occurs when you travel quickly through different time zones and your body has trouble adjusting to the new schedule. This can happen because the sun rises and sets at different times in different parts of the world, and your body's internal clock (called the \"circadian rhythm\") is used to following a certain schedule. When you travel and the schedule changes, it can take your body a while to catch up and feel normal again.Similarly, traveling in a spaceship can also disrupt your body's natural rhythms, especially if you are traveling for a long time or to a place far from Earth where the schedule of day and night is different. This can lead to symptoms similar to jet lag, such as fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and feeling out of sorts.So to answer your question, yes, you could suffer from \"space lag\" when traveling in a spaceship, especially over long distances or to places with different schedules than what your body is used to."],"16379":["Cars don't have direct drive transmission because it would not be efficient or effective for the car to operate.\n\nImagine you are trying to push a heavy box across the floor. If you try to push the box straight ahead with all of your strength, you will quickly get tired and the box will not move very fast. However, if you use a lever to lift the box and then roll it on a wheeled cart, you will be able to move the box much more easily and with less effort.\n\nA car's transmission is like the lever and wheeled cart in this example. It helps the engine to work more efficiently by allowing it to operate at different speeds. For example, when a car is driving at a low speed, the engine does not need to work as hard as it does when the car is driving at a high speed. The transmission allows the engine to operate at a more efficient speed for the given driving conditions, which helps to save fuel and make the car more efficient.\n\nDirect drive transmission, on the other hand, would be like trying to push the box straight ahead with no lever or cart to help. The engine would have to work very hard to move the car, which would be inefficient and would likely cause the engine to wear out more quickly."],"11791":["The value of the Clippers, which is the basketball team that you are asking about, is not determined by whether or not they are on a list like Forbes' \"The world's 50 most valuable sports teams\".

The Clippers may be selling for $2,000,000,000 because the buyer believes that the team is worth that much based on these and other factors."],"7546":["Tenure is a system that protects the job security of teachers and other faculty members at colleges and universities. It is intended to provide academic freedom, which means that teachers can freely express their opinions and ideas without fear of being fired for their views.To achieve tenure, a teacher usually has to work at a school for a certain number of years and meet certain criteria, such as publishing research, teaching effectively, and contributing to the school community. After achieving tenure, a teacher can only be fired for very serious reasons, such as gross misconduct or financial exigency (a situation in which a school is facing financial difficulties).So, in short, tenure provides job security for teachers and allows them to freely express their ideas without fear of being fired."],"11502":["Women's clothing sizes can vary from store to store and brand to brand because there is no standardization for women's clothing sizes.

On the other hand, men's and children's clothing sizes are usually standardized, which means that a size 8 for men or children at one store will be about the same size at another store. The lack of standardization for women's clothing sizes can make it difficult for people to know what size to buy when shopping for clothes."],"13946":["Tourette's syndrome is a condition that causes a person to have involuntary movements and sounds called \"tics.\" These tics can be things like eye blinks, facial grimaces, or vocalizations like grunting or throat clearing. Sometimes people with Tourette's also use words or phrases that are inappropriate or offensive, which is called coprolalia. The exact cause of Tourette's is not known, but it is thought to be related to problems with certain chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters. It is also thought to have a genetic component, meaning it can be passed down from parents to their children. People with Tourette's do not intentionally make these tics and do not mean to say inappropriate things. It is not clear what goes on in the brain before a tic occurs, but it is thought to be related to a sudden, strong urge or sensation that is then relieved by the tic. Swearing or using inappropriate language is just one type of tic that can occur in Tourette's syndrome. It is not known why this particular type of tic happens, but it is not the person's fault and they do not mean to be rude or offensive."],"2523":["In the United States, grades in school are usually given as letters, with A being the highest and F being the lowest. Here's how the grading scale usually works: A: 90% and above, B: 80% to 89%, C: 70% to 79%, D: 60% to 69%, F: Below 60%, Sometimes, schools will also use plus and minus signs to break up the grades a little further. For example: A+: 97% and above, A: 93% to 96%, A-: 90% to 92%, B+: 87% to 89%, B: 83% to 86%, B-: 80% to 82%, And so on. The exact percentages for each grade may vary slightly from school to school. So, if you get an A in a class, it means you did really well and scored in the top 10% of the class. If you get an F, it means you didn't do very well and scored below the bottom 60%.

It would require making significant changes to the planet's atmosphere, surface, and temperature, which would take a lot of time and resources.\n\nOne idea for terraforming Mars is to introduce certain types of organisms, such as lichens, algae, and extremophile bacteria, that are capable of surviving and thriving in extreme conditions. These organisms could potentially help to create a more hospitable environment on Mars by producing oxygen, fixing nitrogen, and potentially even modifying the planet's soil.\n\nHowever, there are a number of challenges and risks associated with sending these types of organisms to Mars. For example, it's not clear how these organisms would survive the harsh conditions of space travel or how they would adapt to the unique environment of Mars. There's also a risk that these organisms could potentially contaminate Mars and interfere with future efforts to study the planet's native biology.\n\nTherefore, while it's possible that introducing certain types of organisms to Mars could be a step towards terraforming the planet, it's important to carefully consider the risks and challenges involved before moving forward with such an ambitious project."],"14328":["When you injure yourself, your body's natural response is to increase blood flow to the area in order to help it heal.

Ukraine strongly condemned the annexation and has repeatedly called for the return of Crimea, but it has not been able to use military force to retake the peninsula because Russia is a much larger and more powerful country with a much larger military. Instead, Ukraine has sought to resist Russia's actions through diplomatic and economic means, such as by imposing sanctions on Russia and seeking support from other countries."],"5455":["Paying off one loan with another loan is generally not a good idea because it can lead to a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape. When you take out a new loan to pay off an old loan, you are essentially replacing the old debt with new debt. This means that you are still responsible for paying back the money you borrowed, but now you have to do it with more expensive terms.\\n\\nFor example, let's say you have a loan with an interest rate of 10% and you take out a new loan with an interest rate of 20% to pay off the old loan. The new loan will cost you more money in the long run because you will have to pay back not only the original amount you borrowed, but also the additional interest.\\n\\nIn addition, taking out a new loan to pay off an old loan can also damage your credit score. This is because it shows that you are unable to manage your debts effectively, which can make it more difficult to get approved for loans or credit cards in the future.\\n\\nIt's generally a better idea to try to pay off your loans as quickly as possible, rather than trying to replace them with new ones. If you are struggling to make your loan payments, it may be helpful to speak with a financial advisor or a credit counselor to see if there are any options for consolidating your debts or negotiating lower interest rates on your existing loans."],"3553":["It is not grammatically incorrect to end a sentence with a preposition in English. In fact, it is quite common and is often necessary to do so in order to convey the intended meaning. The idea that it is wrong to end a sentence with a preposition is a myth that has been passed down for many years. It is likely that this myth originated from Latin, in which ending a sentence with a preposition was considered incorrect because prepositions were not originally part of the Latin language. However, in English, prepositions are an important part of the language and are used to convey relationships between words in a sentence. So, it is perfectly fine to end a sentence with a preposition. Just make sure that the preposition is being used correctly and that it is necessary for the sentence to convey the intended meaning."],"151":["The Mona Lisa is considered a masterpiece of Renaissance art because of the skill and technique used by the artist, Leonardo da Vinci, to create the painting. The Mona Lisa is a portrait of a woman and is known for the enigmatic smile on her face, which is one of the reasons it is so famous. \nOne of the things that makes the Mona Lisa so special is the way Leonardo painted the woman's face and expression. He used a technique called sfumato, which involves blending the colors and tones of the paint so that there are no hard edges or lines. This gives the painting a very soft and natural look, as if the woman is almost alive. \nAnother reason the Mona Lisa is so highly regarded is because of the detail and care that Leonardo put into the painting. He spent many years working on the Mona Lisa, and it shows in the level of detail in the painting. From the folds of the woman's dress to the landscape in the background, everything is carefully and beautifully rendered. \nOverall, the Mona Lisa is considered a masterpiece because of the skill and attention to detail that Leonardo put into the painting, as well as the way he used color and technique to create a sense of depth and realism.

The U.S. government would likely devote significant resources to finding and recovering the gold, and there could be serious consequences for those responsible for the theft. \nThe gold in Fort Knox is not typically used for transactions, but it is considered to be a valuable asset that the U.S. government can use as collateral if it needs to borrow money. \nThe amount of gold in Fort Knox may change over time as gold is added or removed from the repository. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as when the U.S. government buys or sells gold, or when it needs to use the gold as collateral for a loan. However, these changes are typically made in a controlled and carefully planned manner, and they do not happen very often."],"12781":["If you dropped a plugged in toaster into a lake or ocean, the electric current would not be able to spread very far. The reason for this is that the water in the lake or ocean would act as a conductor, or a material that electricity can flow through easily. When electricity flows through a conductor, it will create a path of least resistance, which means it will try to take the easiest and quickest route to get from one place to another. In this case, the water would provide an easier path for the electricity to follow than the air or any other materials around it, so the electricity would be drawn into the water rather than trying to spread out through the air. The electricity would then be carried away by the water and would eventually dissipate, or become weaker and weaker, until it was no longer able to be detected."],"356":["Restaurants might fill their urinals with ice for a few reasons. One reason is to help keep the area around the urinal clean and fresh smelling. When a person uses the urinal, they often splatter a little bit of urine around the area, which can create an unpleasant smell. The ice can help to mask this smell and keep the area smelling fresh. \nAnother reason that restaurants might use ice in their urinals is to help reduce the amount of water that is used. Traditional urinals use a lot of water to flush the urine down the drain. By using ice instead, the restaurant can save water and reduce their water bill. \nFinally, some restaurants might use ice in their urinals simply because it looks cool! Some people find it amusing or interesting to see ice in a place where you wouldn't normally expect it. \nOverall, using ice in a urinal is a way for restaurants to keep their restrooms clean, save water, and potentially add a touch of novelty or fun to the experience of using the facilities."],"7756":["Linguists are able to figure out how ancient and extinct languages were used by studying texts and other written records that have been preserved from those times. These texts can include things like poems, stories, laws, and other documents that were written in the ancient language. By carefully studying these texts, linguists can learn about the grammar and syntax of the language, as well as the words and sounds that were used. They can also use their knowledge of other languages that are related to the ancient language to help them understand it better. In some cases, linguists might also be able to find people who still speak a language that is similar to the ancient language, which can give them more clues about how the ancient language was used."],"15538":["Sure! Here are some examples of evidence for evolution that a five year old might understand:\n\nFossils: When an animal or plant dies, its body may turn into a fossil if it is buried in sand, mud, or other material. Fossils show us what ancient animals and plants looked like and help us understand how they lived.\n\nSimilarities between different species: Many different species have similar features, like eyes, wings, or claws. This is because they have a common ancestor, or a shared ancestor, that had these features.\n\nDifferences between similar species: Even though different species may have similar features, they also have differences. For example, different types of birds may have similar beaks, but they may be different sizes and shapes to help them eat different types of food.\n\nAdaptations: Animals and plants can change, or adapt, over time to better survive in their environment. For example, a bird with a long beak may be better at getting food from deep flowers, while a bird with a short beak may be better at eating seeds on the ground.\n\nI hope these examples help you understand the evidence for evolution! Is there anything else you would like to know about?"],"5753":["Being hot can sometimes make people feel uncomfortable or irritable, and this can lead to them acting more aggressively. This is because when our bodies get too hot, it can affect our ability to think and act clearly. When we're feeling uncomfortable or in a bad mood, it's easier for us to get frustrated or angry at others.\\n\\nIt's also important to remember that people's behavior can be influenced by many different factors, and being hot is just one of them. Some people might be more prone to getting irritable when they're hot, while others might not be affected as much. So if someone is acting aggressively when they're hot, it's not necessarily because of the temperature itself, but because of how it's affecting them personally."],"12396":["Leasing a car can be a good option for some people, but it's not necessarily the best choice for everyone. Here are a few pros and cons to consider when deciding whether to lease or buy a new car: Pros of leasing: Lower monthly payments: Because you're only paying for the portion of the car's value that you use during the lease term (usually 2-4 years), your monthly payments will be lower than if you were to buy the car and finance it over a longer period of time.\nLower upfront costs: When you lease a car, you typically only need to pay a small upfront fee (called a \"down payment\") and any applicable taxes. This can be a good option if you don't have a lot of money saved up to put towards a down payment on a car.\nNo need to worry about selling the car: When you lease a car, you don't have to worry about selling it when you're ready to get a new one. You can simply turn the car back in to the dealership and start a new lease on a different vehicle. Cons of leasing: Limited mileage: Most leases come with a mileage limit (usually around 10,000-15,000 miles per year). If you go over this limit, you'll have to pay extra fees. This can be a problem if you do a lot of driving or take long road trips.\nNo ownership: When you lease a car, you don't actually own it. This means you don't have the freedom to make any modifications or upgrades to the car, and you'll have to turn it back in to the dealership when the lease is up.\nHigher total cost: Although your monthly payments may be lower when you lease a car, you'll end up paying more in total over the long run because you never actually own the car. So, is leasing a good option for an average person? It really depends on your individual circumstances. If you don't drive very much, don't mind turning the car in at the end of the lease, and don't have a lot of money saved up for a down payment, leasing might be a good choice for you. However, if you do a lot of driving, want the freedom to customize your car, or want to eventually own the car outright, it might be better to buy it instead."],"4855":["When you multiply a number by itself, the result is called the square of the number. For example, 3 multiplied by itself is 3 squared, or 3^2, which is equal to 9. When a positive fraction is multiplied by itself, the result is also a positive fraction, but it is smaller than the original fraction.\\n\\nFor example, let's say we have the fraction 1\/2. If we multiply it by itself, we get (1\/2) * (1\/2) = 1\/4. This fraction is smaller than 1\/2 because it has a smaller numerator (the number on the top) and a smaller denominator (the number on the bottom).\\n\\nThe reason that a positive fraction becomes smaller when it is multiplied by itself is because when you multiply two fractions together, you multiply the numerators and the denominators. Since both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction are positive numbers, multiplying them together will always result in a smaller number.\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions."],"5933":["Automobile engines use cylindrical pistons because they are a very effective way to convert the energy produced by burning fuel into mechanical energy that can be used to power a car. There are several reasons why this is the best design:\\n\\nCylindrical pistons are easy to manufacture, so they are relatively inexpensive to produce.\\n\\nCylindrical pistons are strong and durable, so they can withstand the high pressures and temperatures inside an engine.\\n\\nCylindrical pistons can move smoothly up and down inside the engine's cylinders, which helps to reduce friction and wear on the engine.\\n\\nCylindrical pistons are very efficient at transferring energy from the burning fuel to the engine's crankshaft, which is what powers the car.\\n\\nSo, how did we get to this design? It took a lot of trial and error over many years to figure out the best way to design an engine. Engineers have experimented with many different shapes for pistons, and cylindrical pistons have proven to be the most effective."],"9783":["Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally, without any discrimination or preference given to certain websites or services. It means that internet service providers (ISPs) should not be able to block or slow down access to any particular websites or online content.\r\n\r\nIf net neutrality is not in place, it is possible that an ISP could block or slow down access to certain websites or online content. However, using a proxy server could potentially allow you to access these blocked or restricted websites.\r\n\r\nA proxy server is a computer or program that acts as an intermediary between your computer and the internet. When you use a proxy server, your computer sends a request to the proxy server, which then sends the request to the internet on your behalf. The response from the internet is then sent back to the proxy server, which in turn sends it back to your computer.\r\n\r\nBecause the request to access a website or online content is coming from the proxy server and not directly from your computer, it is possible that the ISP may not be able to block or restrict your access to the website or content. However, there is no guarantee that this will always work, as ISPs can potentially block access to proxy servers as well.\r\n\r\nIn short, a proxy server may be able to help you access websites or online content that your ISP is blocking, but there is no guarantee that it will always work."],"15097":["A DVD (short for Digital Versatile Disc or Digital Video Disc) is a type of disc that is used to store and play back video, audio, and other types of data. DVDs are made of a special type of plastic that is coated with a thin layer of metal. This metal layer is where the data is stored.\n\nWhen you insert a DVD into a DVD player or a computer with a DVD drive, a laser is used to read the data on the metal layer. The laser is very precise and can pick up tiny bumps and scratches on the surface of the DVD. These bumps and scratches are actually a code that represents the data that is stored on the DVD.\n\nThe DVD player or computer then converts this code into the video, audio, or other types of data that you can watch or listen to. The DVD player or computer sends this data to your TV or speakers, so you can see or hear it.\n\nSo, in short, a DVD works by using a laser to read the data that is stored on the metal layer of the DVD, and then converting that data into something you can watch or listen to."],"8393":["It's true that China is a major player in the global market for manufactured goods, including cars and cellphones. However, it is not accurate to say that China routinely copies products without getting in trouble or infringing on patents.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there are laws in place that protect intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights. These laws apply to companies and individuals in China, just as they do in other countries. If a company in China were to copy a product without permission, they could be sued for infringing on the patents or other intellectual property rights of the original manufacturer.\r\n\r\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that helps to regulate international trade. One of the ways it does this is by establishing rules for how countries should protect intellectual property. These rules are designed to ensure that companies and individuals who create new products or inventions are able to benefit from their work, and to encourage innovation.\r\n\r\nSo, while China is a major player in the global market for manufactured goods, it is not accurate to say that they are able to freely copy products without consequences. Instead, China, like other countries, has laws in place to protect intellectual property and follows international rules established by the WTO to ensure fair competition in the global market."],"14036":["L'Oreal is a company that makes and sells many different types of beauty and personal care products. They own many different brands, each of which has its own unique products and target customers. For example, Urban Decay is a brand that makes makeup and beauty products for young, edgy consumers, while La Roche Posay is a brand that makes skin care products for people with sensitive skin. Even though L'Oreal owns all of these different brands, they do not compete with each other for profits. Instead, they work together to help the overall company make money. This is because each brand has its own customer base and is targeting different people with different needs and preferences. So, even though L'Oreal has many different brands, they are all working together to help the company succeed. Does that make sense?"],"13769":["The color of your eyes does not affect how much light your eyes filter. All eyes, regardless of their color, filter light in the same way. The color of your eyes is determined by the amount and type of pigments in your iris, as well as by the scattering of light as it passes through the front part of your eye. The iris is the colored part of the eye that surrounds the pupil, which is the black circle in the center of the eye that controls how much light enters the eye. The iris has two main types of pigments: melanin, which is responsible for the color of your skin and hair, and lipochrome, which is responsible for the yellow, green, and blue colors in the iris. The amount and type of pigments in the iris determine the color of your eyes. For example, eyes that have more melanin tend to be darker, such as brown or black, while eyes with less melanin tend to be lighter, such as blue or green. The scattering of light in the front part of the eye can also affect the color of your eyes, causing them to appear lighter or darker. So, to answer your question, the color of your eyes does not affect how much light your eyes filter or how you view the world. Instead, it is determined by the amount and type of pigments in your iris, as well as the scattering of light in the front part of your eye."],"13573":["PLSAs, or Prize-Linked Savings Accounts, are a type of savings account offered by financial institutions that allow people to save money while also having the chance to win prizes. Instead of earning interest on their savings like they would with a traditional savings account, people with PLSAs earn entries into prize drawings by making regular deposits into their account. The prizes for PLSAs are typically funded by the financial institution offering the account or by a partnership with a company or organization. For example, let's say a bank offers a PLSA that has a grand prize of $10,000. Every time someone makes a deposit into their PLSA, they earn one entry into the prize drawing. If someone makes a deposit of $100 into their PLSA, they would earn 100 entries into the prize drawing. The more money someone saves and deposits into their PLSA, the more chances they have to win the prize. PLSAs can be a good way for people to save money and also have some fun, as they get to participate in the prize drawing while they are saving. However, it's important to remember that PLSAs are not a guaranteed way to win money, and the chances of winning a prize will depend on how many people are participating and how many entries each person has."],"2086":["4chan is a website that allows users to post pictures and messages anonymously. It is divided into different boards that are each dedicated to a specific topic, such as politics, video games, and art. One of the things that makes 4chan unique is that it has a very fast pace, with new posts and images appearing constantly. Because of this, it can be a bit overwhelming and confusing to navigate. Additionally, because users can post anonymously, some people use the site to post inappropriate or offensive content.

Some of the ways they might do this include: 1. Using a publicist or personal assistant: Celebrities often have someone else handle their communication with the public, so they can screen calls and emails before they reach the celebrity. 2. Using a separate phone or email for public use: Celebrities might have a separate phone or email that they use for public communication, which helps keep their personal information private. 3. Using a phone or email with a pseudonym: Celebrities might use a fake name or pseudonym when setting up their phone or email, so it's harder for people to track down their personal information. 4. Using privacy settings: Celebrities might use privacy settings on their social media accounts or other online profiles to control who can see their personal information. 5. Being careful about who they give their information to: Celebrities might be selective about who they share their personal information with, and might only give it out to trusted friends and family members. Overall, celebrities often have a team of people working to protect their privacy, and they are careful about how they share their personal information. This helps to keep their information private and prevent any privacy issues from happening."],"15698":["The word \"o'clock\" actually comes from the phrase \"of the clock.\" When people used to tell time on a clock, they would say something like \"it is seven of the clock,\" meaning that the hands on the clock were pointing to the number seven.

This includes copying the program files to your computer's storage, creating shortcuts and icons for the program, and setting up any necessary system settings or configurations. All of this takes time, especially if the program is large or has a lot of components that need to be installed. On the other hand, when you uninstall a program, your computer is simply removing the program files and any related settings or configurations. This process is usually much quicker, because the computer doesn't have to do as much work. Think of it like building a house. Building a house takes a lot of time and effort, because you have to lay the foundation, put up walls, install plumbing and electrical systems, and so on. Tearing down a house is much quicker, because you're just taking everything apart and getting rid of it. Uninstalling a program is similar - it takes less time because you're just removing it, rather than setting it up in the first place."],"10236":["It is difficult to prove that one search engine's results are definitively superior to another's, as search algorithms and the ranking of search results are complex and constantly evolving. In general, it is up to individual users to decide which search engine they prefer based on their own personal experiences and needs.\r\n\r\nOne way to compare the quality of search results from different search engines is to perform the same search on both engines and compare the results. However, even this approach has limitations, as the results for a given search can vary based on the user's location, device, and search history, among other factors.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to conduct a controlled study in which a group of people are asked to perform the same search on both Google and Bing and evaluate the quality of the results.

To build a rope bridge over a long distance, people would first find a place where the gap was not too wide and not too deep. Then, they would tie ropes to trees or other sturdy objects on either side of the gap. Next, they would stretch the ropes across the gap and tie them securely to more trees or other sturdy objects on the other side. Finally, they would add more ropes or other materials, such as wooden planks or bamboo poles, to create a surface for people to walk on. It could be a challenging process, but with careful planning and strong, sturdy materials, it was possible for people to build rope bridges that could span long distances."],"10007":["When you lease a new vehicle, you are essentially renting it from the dealership or the manufacturer for a set period of time, usually two to four years. You will make monthly payments for the duration of the lease, but at the end of the lease period, you will need to return the vehicle to the dealership. Leasing can be a good option if you don't want to commit to owning a car for a long time, you want to drive a new car every few years, or you don't want to worry about the maintenance and repair costs of an older car.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, financing a new vehicle means taking out a loan to pay for the car, and then making monthly payments to pay off the loan over a set period of time, usually three to seven years. Once you have paid off the loan, you own the car. Financing can be a good option if you want to own the car and keep it for a long time, you want to customize the car or make changes to it, or you don't want to have to worry about returning the car at the end of the lease period.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the decision to lease or finance a new vehicle will depend on your personal circumstances, financial situation, and long-term goals.

It involves injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to create fractures in the rock, which allows the oil and gas to flow more easily and be extracted.\n\nThere are several arguments for and against fracking:\n\nARGUMENTS FOR FRACKING:\n\nFracking can provide a domestic source of energy: Fracking has helped the United States become less dependent on foreign sources of oil and natural gas. This can help to stabilize energy prices and reduce the need for importing energy from other countries.\n\nFracking can create jobs: The fracking industry employs a large number of people, including engineers, geologists, and truck drivers.\n\nFracking can lower energy prices: Fracking has helped to increase the supply of oil and natural gas, which can lower energy prices for consumers.\n\nARGUMENTS AGAINST FRACKING:\n\nFracking can pollute the environment: Fracking can potentially contaminate the air and water with chemicals used in the fracking process. There have also been reports of methane leaks, which contribute to climate change.\n\nFracking can cause earthquakes: There have been instances where fracking has been linked to small earthquakes in certain areas.\n\nFracking can impact public health: Some people believe that fracking can have negative impacts on public health, including respiratory problems and other health issues.\n\nOverall, the arguments for and against fracking are complex and there are valid points on both sides.

When you buy a new car, it is worth a lot of money because it is in excellent condition and has all of the latest features. However, as you use the car and drive it around, it starts to show signs of wear and tear. This includes things like scratches, dents, and other damage to the exterior, as well as things like worn tires and brakes.\\n\\nAs a car gets older and starts to show more wear and tear, it becomes less valuable because it is not in as good of condition as it was when it was brand new. In addition, as new models of cars are released, the older models become less in demand and therefore lose value more quickly. This is why it is common for cars to depreciate very quickly when they are driven off the lot for the first time."],"2997":["Outsourcing is when a company hires someone from another country to do a job that is usually done by people who work for the company. Some people think outsourcing is a good thing because it can help a company save money.

This can be especially helpful for small businesses that don't have a lot of money to spend on salaries. However, some people think outsourcing is a bad thing because it can lead to people losing their jobs. If a company hires someone from another country to do a job that was previously done by someone in their own country, the person in their own country might lose their job.

If you just hit the metal sheet with the can, it would make a dent but it wouldn't cut through. But if you took the can and squished it into a cone shape so that the top is smaller than the bottom, then lit the fuse and placed it on the metal sheet with the small end touching the metal, the blast from the explosion would go straight through the metal sheet because the shape of the can is directing the blast in a specific direction. That's how a shaped charge works."],"14665":["Al Jazeera is a news network based in Qatar that is available in many countries around the world, but it is not currently available as a television channel in the United States. There are a few reasons for this. One reason is that Al Jazeera is funded by the government of Qatar, and some people in the United States have expressed concerns about the potential for bias in the network's reporting because of this funding.\n\nAnother reason is that Al Jazeera has faced criticism in the past for its coverage of certain events, and some people in the United States have questioned the accuracy and objectivity of the network's reporting.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other news networks, like FOX, CNN, and BBC, are able to broadcast in the United States because they have obtained licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is a government agency that regulates television and radio broadcasting in the United States. Al Jazeera has not obtained a license from the FCC to broadcast in the United States, so it is not currently able to do so.\n\nI hope this helps to clarify things. Is there anything else you would like to know?"],"5189":["\\nLint is made up of small fibers that come off of clothes and other fabrics during the washing and drying process. These fibers can come from many different sources, such as towels, sheets, and clothes made from natural materials like cotton or wool.\\n\\nThe color of the lint that you see in the dryer may appear greyish blue because of the way that light reflects off of the fibers. Lint is made up of very small fibers, and these fibers can scatter light in different directions. This can cause the lint to appear to be a different color than the clothes that it came from.\\n\\nAdditionally, some clothes and fabrics may contain dyes or pigments that can give the lint a different color. For example, if you wash a load of clothes that includes some blue jeans, the lint from those jeans might have a bluish tint to it.\\n\\nOverall, the color of lint can vary based on the type of fabrics that are being washed and the way that light reflects off of the fibers."],"12868":["Abortion is not considered murder because it is a medical procedure that is used to end a pregnancy. It is only performed with the consent of the person who is pregnant, and it is generally considered to be a safe and legal way to end a pregnancy. On the other hand, a double homicide refers to a situation where two people are killed at the same time. If a pregnant woman is murdered, it is considered a double homicide because both the woman and the fetus inside of her are killed. This is because, in many places, the law considers a fetus to be a person with certain legal rights. I hope this helps to clear things up. Do you have any other questions about this topic?"],"12538":["CAPTCHAs, or Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, are designed to be difficult for computers to solve, but easy for humans. They are often used on websites to make sure that a real person, rather than a computer program, is interacting with the site. One reason why computers might have trouble solving CAPTCHAs is because they are designed to be difficult for computers to read. CAPTCHAs often use distorted or overlapping letters and numbers, and they may also include background noise or other visual distractions. These features make it difficult for a computer to recognize the characters in the CAPTCHA, even if it has an image recognition system. Another reason why computers might have trouble solving CAPTCHAs is because they are designed to be unpredictable. Different CAPTCHAs will look different each time they are shown, so a computer program that is designed to solve one CAPTCHA might not be able to solve another. This makes it difficult for computer programs to learn how to solve CAPTCHAs and makes them less effective at bypassing the test. Overall, CAPTCHAs are designed to be a challenge for computers, but easy for humans to solve. This helps to protect websites from automated programs, or bots, that might try to interact with them in unwanted or harmful ways."],"7007":["Addiction is a complex process that can involve many different factors, including genetics, environment, and psychology. People can become physically addicted to a substance even if they take breaks from consuming it while sleeping. This is because the body can build up a tolerance to the substance, which means that it takes more of the substance to achieve the same effect as before. As a result, people may feel the need to use the substance more often or in larger amounts in order to feel the desired effects. Additionally, the body can also go through withdrawal when a person stops using a substance that they have become physically dependent on. This can cause physical and emotional symptoms that can be uncomfortable and may lead a person to use the substance again in order to feel better."],"6085":["Michael Jackson did not turn white overnight. It is believed that he suffered from a skin condition called vitiligo, which causes the loss of pigment in the skin. It is not uncommon for people with vitiligo to develop white patches on their skin, and it is possible that this is what caused the changes in Michael Jackson's skin tone that you may have noticed. It is also possible that he used skin bleaching creams or other treatments to lighten his skin tone. It is important to note that it is not uncommon for people with vitiligo to experience teasing or bullying because of the changes in their appearance, and it is possible that this may have had an impact on Michael Jackson."],"539":["Scars are a natural part of the healing process when your skin is injured. When your skin is cut or damaged, your body works to repair the wound by making new skin cells. As the skin heals, a scar may form. Scars are different from the surrounding skin because they don't have the same amount of collagen, which is a protein that helps give skin its strength and elasticity. This is why scars are often flatter and smoother than the skin around them. \nSometimes, scars can be itchy or painful. This is because the scar tissue is still healing and your body is trying to adjust to the new tissue. But over time, the scar tissue will become less sensitive and blend in more with the rest of your skin. \nIt's important to take good care of your skin, especially if you have a cut or wound. Keep the area clean and use a bandage to protect it. This can help prevent infection and speed up the healing process."],"14458":["The severe weather alert system that broadcasts over your television uses a specific tone to alert people that there is an emergency. This tone is called the Emergency Alert System (EAS) tone. It was designed to be easily recognizable and to get people's attention, even if they are not paying attention to the television or if the volume is turned down. The EAS tone is used for all kinds of emergencies, not just severe weather. The EAS tone might sound like you are logging on to the internet in the 90's because it is a very old system. It was developed in the 1950s and has been updated several times since then, but it is still based on the same basic principles. The tone is played through the speakers of your television, just like the sound of a computer logging on to the internet would be played through the speakers of your computer."],"11204":["Harry did not destroy the Invisibility Cloak because it did not have the power to cause harm or destruction like the other two objects, the Elder Wand and the Philosopher's Stone. The Invisibility Cloak was a valuable and useful object that could protect Harry and others from being seen or found. It was a gift from his father, James Potter, and had been passed down through the Potter family for generations. Harry chose to keep the Invisibility Cloak and pass it down to his own children because it was a special and sentimental object to him."],"6568":["Storing nuclear waste in space is not currently a practical solution because it would be very expensive and technically challenging to do so. The main problem with storing nuclear waste in space is that it would require a lot of energy and resources to launch the waste into orbit and transport it to the moon or another planet. It would also be difficult to ensure that the waste would remain safely stored for the hundreds or thousands of years that it needs to be kept away from Earth. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential environmental impacts of storing nuclear waste on other celestial bodies.A better solution for storing nuclear waste is to keep it safely on Earth, where it can be monitored and managed over time. This involves finding a location that is geologically stable and safe from natural disasters, and then building a facility to store the waste in a way that will prevent it from leaking or causing any harm to people or the environment. There are also ongoing efforts to develop new technologies and methods for safely disposing of nuclear waste, such as burying it deep underground or converting it into a less harmful form."],"11195":["Penny bid sites are online auctions where you can bid on items for just a few cents at a time. Here's how they work:\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to sign up for an account on the penny bid site.\r\n\r\nThen, you can browse through the different items that are up for auction.\r\n\r\nWhen you find an item you want to bid on, you enter the maximum amount you are willing to pay for the item.\r\n\r\nEvery time someone else bids on the item, the price goes up by a few cents.\r\n\r\nThe auction ends when no one else wants to bid on the item, and the person who has the highest bid wins the auction and gets the item.\r\n\r\nSo basically, you are competing with other people to see who can bid the most on an item. The key is to bid early and often, so that you have a good chance of winning the auction."],"3484":["The NES Zapper was a gun-shaped controller used with the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), a popular home video game console in the 1980s. The Zapper worked by using a simple light sensor to detect when you pointed it at the screen and pulled the trigger. Here's how it worked: You would hold the Zapper in your hand and aim it at the screen, just like you would a real gun. When you pulled the trigger, the Zapper would send a beam of light out of the barrel of the gun and onto the screen. If the beam of light hit something on the screen (like a target or an enemy), the Zapper would send a signal back to the NES console, telling it that you had hit the target. The NES console would then respond by making the target disappear (if it was an enemy) or giving you points (if it was a target). So, in summary, the NES Zapper worked by using a beam of light and a light sensor to detect when you were aiming at something on the screen and pulling the trigger. This allowed you to play video games that involved shooting or aiming at targets."],"1392":["A blank is a type of cartridge that does not contain a bullet or any other projectile. It is used for training, simulation, and ceremonial purposes, and can also be used in special effects for movies and television. When a blank is fired from a gun, the gunpowder inside the cartridge is ignited and creates a loud noise and a burst of gas, but there is no bullet or other projectile that is expelled from the barrel of the gun. \nA live round, on the other hand, is a cartridge that contains a bullet or other projectile and is designed to be fired from a gun with the intent of hitting a target. Live rounds are usually used for hunting, self-defense, and other situations where a person wants to cause harm or damage. The mechanics of a live round are similar to those of a blank, but the live round also contains a bullet or other projectile that is propelled out of the barrel of the gun when it is fired. The effectiveness of a live round depends on a variety of factors, including the type of gun it is fired from, the distance to the target, and the accuracy of the person firing the gun."],"14292":["A reverse mortgage is a type of loan that allows people who are 62 or older to borrow money using their home as collateral. Instead of making monthly payments to a lender, the lender makes payments to the borrower. The borrower does not have to pay the loan back until they sell their home, move out permanently, or pass away. The borrower is still responsible for paying property taxes, insurance, and maintenance on the home. Reverse mortgages can be a good option for people who are retired and have a lot of equity in their home but not a lot of income. They can use the money from the reverse mortgage to pay bills, make home improvements, or just have extra money to spend. However, reverse mortgages can be expensive and have many fees, so it is important for people to carefully consider whether a reverse mortgage is the right choice for them."],"6216":["That's a great question! The reason we don't see solid objects that are the color of infrared or ultraviolet light is because those colors are not visible to our eyes. Our eyes are only able to see a certain range of colors, which we call the visible spectrum. Infrared and ultraviolet light are outside of this range, so we can't see them. Just because we can't see them doesn't mean they don't exist though! We can use special equipment to detect and measure infrared and ultraviolet light, and we know that they are real. So even though we don't bump into solid objects that are the color of infrared or ultraviolet light, they are still there and can be detected in other ways."],"9750":["There are a few reasons why children might fall asleep in the car more easily than in other places. One reason is that the motion of the car can be soothing and help to relax the body. The sound of the car's engine and the hum of the tires on the road can also be calming and make it easier to fall asleep. The darkness inside the car can also be conducive to sleep, as it can be easier to fall asleep in a darker environment. Additionally, the car may provide a sense of security and familiarity for the child, which can help them feel more relaxed and fall asleep more easily."],"3811":["In a bobsled, the two people in the middle are called the \"pushers.\" They are responsible for helping the bobsled get a good start at the beginning of the run. When the bobsled is at the starting line, the pushers will push the bobsled as hard as they can to get it moving. Once the bobsled is moving, the pushers will jump into the back of the bobsled and hold on tight. The pushers are very important because they help the bobsled get a fast start, which can make a big difference in the overall time for the run. They also help to balance the bobsled and keep it stable as it goes down the track."],"9425":["Defusing a bomb is not exactly like it is portrayed in movies, but there are some similarities. In real life, cutting a wire on a bomb might not be as easy as it seems. First of all, it's important to know which wire to cut. Some bombs have multiple wires, and cutting the wrong one could cause the bomb to explode. Additionally, some bombs are designed to explode if certain wires are cut or tampered with. This is why bomb technicians need to be very careful when they are trying to defuse a bomb.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways to defuse a bomb besides cutting wires. For example, bomb technicians might use special tools to disable the timer or remove the explosives from the bomb. But again, it's important to be very careful when doing this, because any mistake could cause the bomb to explode.\r\n\r\nSo, to answer your question, it's not necessarily that the wire between the bomb and the timer can't be cut, but it can be dangerous to do so. Bomb technicians need to be trained and careful when they are trying to defuse a bomb, and they use special tools and techniques to do so safely."],"1245":["Human babies are born much less developed than other animals because their brains and bodies are still growing and developing after they are born. This means that they are not able to do many things that adult humans can do, such as walk, talk, or take care of themselves. \nOther animals, like kittens and puppies, are born with fur and are able to walk and eat solid food right away because they need to be able to take care of themselves from the moment they are born. They are born into a world where they need to be able to survive on their own. \nHuman babies, on the other hand, are born into a world where they are taken care of and protected by their parents or other caregivers. This gives them the time they need to grow and develop at their own pace. \nSo, even though human babies may seem helpless and incapable at first, they are actually just going through a normal part of the development process. With time and care, they will eventually grow and become more independent."],"4624":["When you shake a pressurized can, you are causing the gas inside to mix with the liquid. This process causes a decrease in temperature, similar to how sweating cools your body. The can gets cold because the gas inside is releasing some of its heat as it mixes with the liquid.\\n\\nThink of the gas inside the can as being like a group of people all crowded together in a room. They are all touching each other and sharing their heat, so the room stays warm. But if you open a window and let some of the people out, they will spread out and take up more space. This will cause the temperature in the room to drop because there are fewer people to share the heat. In the same way, when the gas inside the can mixes with the liquid, it spreads out and takes up more space, causing the temperature to drop."],"1232":["Lizard Squad is a group of hackers who have gained notoriety for various cyber attacks and security breaches. It is not clear exactly how they were able to hack Xbox Live, but it is likely that they exploited vulnerabilities in the system or found ways to bypass security measures. \nHacking is the act of accessing computer systems or networks without proper authorization. Hackers use a variety of techniques, such as writing and using malicious software (also known as malware), exploiting vulnerabilities in software or systems, or using social engineering techniques to trick people into revealing sensitive information. \nIt is important to note that even large, well-established companies like Microsoft can be vulnerable to hacking attacks. This is why it is important for companies to constantly update their systems and take steps to secure them against potential threats."],"471":["The \"I Can Be A Computer Engineer\" Barbie book has been criticized for perpetuating harmful stereotypes about computer engineers and for promoting a narrow and unrealistic view of what it means to be a computer engineer. \nOne issue with the book is that it portrays Barbie as the main character who is responsible for all the technical work, while her classmates are shown as simply helping her or providing support. This reinforces the stereotype that computer engineering is a field for men and that women are only helpers or assistants. \nAnother issue is that the book portrays computer engineering as a solitary activity, rather than a collaborative and team-based discipline. In reality, computer engineering involves working with a diverse team of people with a range of skills and expertise, and often involves collaboration and communication with others. \nOverall, the \"I Can Be A Computer Engineer\" Barbie book promotes a limited and one-dimensional view of what it means to be a computer engineer, and does not accurately reflect the diverse and collaborative nature of the field."],"13290":["Spicy foods can create a burning sensation when you eat them because they contain compounds called capsaicinoids, which are found in certain types of peppers. Capsaicinoids bind to a protein called TRPV1, which is found on nerve cells in your mouth, throat, and digestive tract. When capsaicinoids bind to TRPV1, they can stimulate the nerve cells and cause a burning sensation. The reason you might feel a second burn after you eat spicy foods is because the capsaicinoids can also be absorbed into your bloodstream and travel to other parts of your body, including your anus. When the capsaicinoids reach your anus, they can bind to TRPV1 receptors there and cause a burning sensation. This is why you might feel a burn when you have a bowel movement after eating spicy foods. It's worth noting that not everyone experiences this \"second burn\" after eating spicy foods, and the intensity of the burn can vary from person to person. Some people might not feel any burn at all, while others might experience a very strong burn. The sensitivity to capsaicinoids can also vary depending on the type and amount of spicy food that you eat."],"6789":["Being shorter or taller than the average height can affect your life in some ways, but it's important to remember that everyone is different and there are many different ways to be happy and successful in life.

This is different from how things work in a lot of other societies, where people own their own businesses and keep the profits for themselves."],"12116":["Patent trolls are companies or individuals who own patents but do not use them to make products or provide services. Instead, they try to make money by suing or threatening to sue other companies that are using a technology that might be covered by the troll's patent. Startup companies may be especially vulnerable to patent trolls because they often have limited resources and may not have the money or legal expertise to defend themselves against a lawsuit. Even if the startup wins the case, the cost of defending against the lawsuit can be very expensive and time-consuming, which can be a major burden for a small company. Patent trolls can pose a threat to startup companies because they may try to stop the startup from using a particular technology or selling their products, which can prevent the startup from growing and succeeding."],"7575":["Car doors can provide some protection against bullets, but they are not designed to be bulletproof. While it is true that rounds can pass through car doors, they can still provide some level of protection for the person behind them.Imagine that you are standing behind a thin piece of cardboard. If someone throws a rock at you from a few feet away, the cardboard might not be able to stop the rock from hitting you. However, if the rock is thrown from a greater distance, the cardboard might be able to slow it down enough to reduce the force of the impact and potentially prevent you from getting hurt.Similarly, car doors can slow down or deflect bullets, which can reduce the risk of injury or death for the person behind them. However, they are not foolproof and can still be penetrated by bullets, especially if they are fired from close range or if the bullets are powerful enough.So while car doors are not bulletproof, they can still provide some level of protection in certain situations, and that is why you may see police officers using them as a shield. It is important to remember that the best way to stay safe during a shooting is to find cover or get as far away from the shooter as possible."],"9738":["Orange juice is a natural beverage made from the juice of oranges. It can be a good source of Vitamin C and other nutrients, but it is also high in natural sugars and calories. Drinking too much orange juice can contribute to weight gain and tooth decay, just like drinking too much of any sugary drink can. However, orange juice is not as unhealthy as many soft drinks, which are often loaded with added sugars and artificial ingredients that have no nutritional value.\r\n\r\nIt's important to consume any type of food or drink, including orange juice, in moderation as part of a balanced diet. It's also a good idea to choose fresh or 100% juice options and to avoid drinks that are high in added sugars. Water, milk, and other unsweetened beverages can be healthier choices for quenching your thirst."],"1509":["Kwanzaa is a cultural holiday that is celebrated by some people of African descent in the United States and other parts of the world. It was created in 1966 by a man named Maulana Karenga, who was a professor of African studies. The holiday is based on traditional African customs and values, and it is meant to be a time for people to come together and celebrate their heritage and culture. \nKwanzaa is celebrated from December 26th to January 1st each year. During this time, people often decorate their homes with items such as candles, fruits, and other items that are meaningful to their culture. They also hold gatherings with their friends and family, where they may share traditional African foods, music, and dance. \nKwanzaa is not a religious holiday, but it is a time for people to reflect on their culture and traditions, and to think about the values that are important to them. It is a time for people to celebrate their community and to come together with others who share similar cultural experiences."],"7981":["Objective reality refers to the way that things exist independently of our perception or interpretation of them. It is the idea that there is a true, objective reality \"out there\" that exists regardless of whether or not we are aware of it or agree on it.\r\n\r\nFor example, the sun is an objective reality. It exists whether or not we are aware of it, and it will continue to exist even if we stop believing in it. Similarly, the laws of physics are an objective reality. They describe the way that matter and energy behave, and they apply regardless of whether or not we agree with them or understand them.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that our understanding of objective reality is always limited by our ability to observe and measure it. We can never fully understand the true nature of objective reality, but we can use science and other methods to learn more about it and to develop theories that can help us make predictions about how it works."],"8208":["Laughter is a natural response to certain stimuli, such as jokes, funny situations, or even physical tickling. When we laugh, we make a series of short, explosive sounds with our mouths. These sounds are called \"laughter.\"\r\n\r\nLaughter is a way for us to show that we are happy or amused. It's also a way for us to bond with other people and to release tension or stress. When we laugh, our bodies release chemicals called endorphins, which can help us feel good.\r\n\r\nWhen we laugh, our bodies also make a series of physical movements, such as smiling, crinkling our eyes, and possibly even snorting or guffawing. These movements are all part of the process of laughter.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum it up, laughter is a natural response that we have when we are happy or amused, and it helps us feel good and bond with others. It's a fun and healthy way to express our emotions!"],"11385":["Autism is a condition that affects how a person thinks, learns, and interacts with others. People with autism might have some special skills or abilities, such as being really good at drawing or remembering things. But they might also have some challenges, such as having trouble communicating with others or understanding social rules.\r\n\r\nIt's not really fair to say that autism is a \"bad\" thing, because it's just a different way of thinking and learning.

In fact, many people with autism are really talented and special in their own unique ways."],"16347":["It's normal to have moments when you feel distracted or forgetful, and it's okay to take breaks or have some down time. Sometimes, when we are working on a task or trying to concentrate, our minds can wander and we might start thinking about other things. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as feeling stressed or overwhelmed, being tired, or simply having too much on our minds. It's important to take care of ourselves and give ourselves breaks when we need them.

Overclocking is the process of making a computer's processor run faster than the speed it was designed for. This can be done by changing the settings in the computer's BIOS (Basic Input\/Output System) or by using special software. While overclocking can make a computer run faster and more efficiently, it can also cause the computer to become unstable and crash, or even damage the hardware if done improperly. Additionally, overclocking a computer requires careful monitoring and adjustments to ensure that the computer is stable and not overheating. If a manufacturer were to overclock a computer before selling it, they would need to carefully test and monitor the computer to ensure that it is safe and stable, which would add additional time and cost to the production process. In general, it is usually safer and more cost-effective for manufacturers to sell computers with processors running at their default speeds, and leave it up to the user to decide whether they want to try overclocking their computer. This way, the user can take on the responsibility of monitoring and adjusting their computer's settings if they choose to overclock it, and they can also void the warranty if they run into any issues as a result."],"8902":["It's true that China is a major player in the global market for manufactured goods, including cars and cellphones. However, it is not accurate to say that China routinely copies products without getting in trouble or infringing on patents.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there are laws in place that protect intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights. These laws apply to companies and individuals in China, just as they do in other countries. If a company in China were to copy a product without permission, they could be sued for infringing on the patents or other intellectual property rights of the original manufacturer.\r\n\r\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that helps to regulate international trade. One of the ways it does this is by establishing rules for how countries should protect intellectual property. These rules are designed to ensure that companies and individuals who create new products or inventions are able to benefit from their work, and to encourage innovation.\r\n\r\nSo, while China is a major player in the global market for manufactured goods, it is not accurate to say that they are able to freely copy products without consequences. Instead, China, like other countries, has laws in place to protect intellectual property and follows international rules established by the WTO to ensure fair competition in the global market."],"16107":["A Roth IRA is a type of individual retirement account (IRA) that allows you to save for retirement in a tax-advantaged way. It is named after Senator William Roth, who sponsored the legislation that created it.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nYou contribute money to a Roth IRA, which you can do either by making a one-time contribution or by making regular contributions over time. The money you contribute is called \"after-tax\" money because you have already paid taxes on it.\n\nThe money in your Roth IRA grows over time, and you can invest it in a variety of different investments, such as mutual funds, stocks, and bonds.\n\nWhen you retire and start withdrawing money from your Roth IRA, you do not have to pay taxes on the money you withdraw. This is because you have already paid taxes on the money you contributed to the Roth IRA.\n\nThere are limits to how much you can contribute to a Roth IRA each year. In 2021, the maximum contribution is $6,000 for people under age 50 and $7,000 for people age 50 and over.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any other questions about Roth IRAs, just let me know."],"13882":["It's not accurate to say that all Americans automatically assume that products made in Europe are higher quality. There are many factors that can influence people's perceptions of the quality of a product, and where it is made is just one of them. It's also important to note that people's perceptions and opinions can vary greatly, and not everyone may agree on what constitutes a high-quality product. One reason that some people may perceive European-made products as being of higher quality is that many European countries have long histories of producing high-quality goods, particularly in industries such as fashion, automotive, and luxury goods. These industries often place a strong emphasis on craftsmanship and attention to detail, which can contribute to the perception of higher quality. Additionally, some European countries have stricter regulations and standards for manufacturing and product safety, which may also contribute to the perception of higher quality. Finally, it's possible that marketing and branding efforts by European companies may also play a role in shaping people's perceptions of the quality of their products. It's important to keep in mind that just because a product is made in Europe does not necessarily mean it is automatically of higher quality. It's always a good idea to do your own research and consider multiple factors when evaluating the quality of a product."],"8505":["Vegetarians are people who do not eat meat, but they may still eat other animal products like milk, eggs, and cheese. Some vegetarians choose to exclude all animal products from their diet and are called vegans.\r\n\r\nRennet is an enzyme that is used to help make cheese. It is often made from the stomachs of young cows, but it can also be made from other sources, like plants. Some vegetarians are okay with eating cheese made with rennet because they do not consider it to be the same as eating meat. They may view the use of rennet as a byproduct of the dairy industry and not something that involves directly killing animals for food.\r\n\r\nOthers may choose to avoid cheese made with rennet because they do not want to support any industry that involves the use of animal products. Some vegetarians and vegans also avoid cheese made with rennet because they consider it to be less ethical or more environmentally harmful than plant-based alternatives.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that everyone has their own personal beliefs and values when it comes to what they choose to eat. Some people may feel more comfortable with certain choices than others, and that's okay.

The first stage of a rocket is the part that helps lift the rocket off the ground and into space. When a rocket launches, the first stage falls back down to Earth after it's done its job. In the past, this first stage was always discarded and left to crash into the ocean or another remote area.SpaceX, a company founded by Elon Musk, has developed a way to land the first stage of its rockets back on the ground after it finishes its job. This is significant because it means that the first stage can be reused, rather than being thrown away. Reusing the first stage of a rocket can save a lot of money, because building a new first stage is expensive. It can also make it easier and cheaper to send things into space, which could help us explore more of the universe and do things like send people to live on other planets."],"14645":["It's normal to not remember being a baby because our brains are still developing and don't have the ability to store memories in the same way they do when we're older. As we get older, our brains get better at forming and storing memories, which is why we might have clearer memories of events that happened when we were a bit older. Some people might have better memories of their early years because they have a natural talent for remembering things or because they have practiced ways to help them remember, such as by taking notes or talking about their experiences with others."],"16133":["It is not generally recommended to remove a knife or any other object that has been stuck in someone's body, because doing so can cause additional injury or damage. When a knife or other sharp object is stuck in the body, it can cause bleeding and damage to internal organs and tissues. Removing the object can cause these injuries to worsen and can even lead to death if the person is not properly trained and equipped to handle the situation. It is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible if someone has been stabbed or otherwise injured. The professionals at the hospital are trained to handle these types of situations and have the necessary equipment and expertise to safely treat the person and minimize the risk of further harm."],"4939":["Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon, which means that it is a type of carbon that has an unstable nucleus and is therefore prone to decay. This means that over time, the carbon-14 atoms in a substance will break down into other, more stable atoms. However, this process takes a very long time, and the rate at which carbon-14 decays is relatively slow.\\n\\nWhen living things are alive, they constantly take in carbon from the environment in the form of carbon dioxide. This carbon is then used to build the tissues and organs of the living thing. Some of the carbon that the living thing takes in will be carbon-14, and this carbon-14 will be incorporated into the tissues and organs of the living thing just like any other type of carbon.\\n\\nWhen the living thing dies, it stops taking in carbon from the environment, and the carbon-14 in its tissues and organs begins to decay. Scientists can use this process to determine how old a piece of organic material is. They do this by measuring the amount of carbon-14 that is left in the material and comparing it to the amount of carbon-14 that was present when the living thing was alive. By knowing the rate at which carbon-14 decays, scientists can calculate how long it has been since the living thing died.\\n\\nI hope this helps to clarify things!

It was very popular, and many people used it to store and share all kinds of files, including music, movies, games, and documents.\n\nThe reason that Megaupload was so popular was that it offered a way for people to share files easily and quickly, without having to worry about running out of space on their own computers or devices. This can be especially useful for people who have a lot of large files, or who need to share files with other people who are far away.\n\nHowever, Megaupload was shut down by the government in 2012 because it was being used by some people to share copyrighted material illegally. This caused a lot of controversy and sparked a debate about the role of file-sharing services in the digital age."],"5322":["\\nRulers in the past had to rely on slower methods of communication, such as sending messengers on horseback or by boat, to give orders and share information with the people they ruled over. They also used symbols and signs, such as flags or banners, to represent their power and to communicate with their subjects.\\n\\nFor example, Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire used a system of messengers called \"yam\" to send messages and orders across the vast territory they controlled. These messengers were trained to ride horses at a fast pace and could cover great distances in a short amount of time. Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire used a similar system of messengers called \"cursus publicus\" to communicate with the people they ruled over.\\n\\nRulers also used their own personal charisma and reputation to inspire and lead their subjects. They would often make public appearances and give speeches to rally their people and demonstrate their leadership. In addition, they would often surround themselves with advisors and officials who could help them make decisions and carry out their orders.\\n\\nOverall, rulers in the past had to rely on a combination of slower methods of communication and their own personal leadership skills to effectively lead their subjects and manage the affairs of their empires.\\n\\n\\n\\n"],"16417":["There are many reasons why Jews have been mistreated, blamed, and oppressed throughout history.

Here's how it works: First, you need a torrent client, which is a special program that allows you to download and share files using torrents. Some examples of torrent clients are uTorrent and BitTorrent. Next, you need to find a torrent file, which is a small file that contains information about the larger file you want to download. This information includes the name of the file, its size, and the location of the file on the internet. Once you have a torrent client and a torrent file, you can start the download process. The torrent client will connect to a network of computers called seeds, which are computers that have already downloaded the file you want. The seeds will then send small pieces of the file to your computer, and the torrent client will piece them together to create the final file. As you download the file, you can also share it with other people who are also downloading the file. This means that the more people who are downloading the file, the faster the download will be for everyone. So, in summary, a torrent is a way to download large files from the internet by connecting to a network of computers and sharing the download with other people. This makes it faster and more efficient than downloading a large file from a single source."],"1832":["Stephen Colbert is a comedian and television host who has used his platform to bring attention to political issues, often in a humorous way. One way he did this was by creating a Super PAC, which stands for \"Political Action Committee.\" A Super PAC is a type of organization that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose political candidates. Colbert's Super PAC was called \"Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow,\" and it was created as part of a satirical commentary on the role of money in politics. Colbert used the Super PAC to raise and spend money on campaign-style advertisements, and to highlight the ways in which Super PACs can be used to influence elections. The purpose of Colbert's Super PAC was not necessarily to prove or do anything specific, but rather to use satire and humor to draw attention to the role of money in politics and the influence of special interests on elections. By using his platform to bring attention to these issues, Colbert hoped to educate and engage the public in discussions about political reform."],"524":["Starting your own nation is not as simple as finding an island and declaring it to be a country. In order for a nation to be recognized as a country, it generally must meet certain criteria, such as having a defined territory, a permanent population, a functioning government, and the ability to enter into relationships with other countries. \nIn order to be recognized as a country by the international community, a nation must also be recognized by other countries. This typically involves other countries formally acknowledging the existence of the new nation and establishing diplomatic relations with it. \nIt is also important to note that many islands are already claimed by other countries, and it may not be legal or possible to simply declare an island to be a new nation. Additionally, starting a new nation would likely require a significant amount of resources and logistical planning, as well as potentially facing challenges such as obtaining international recognition and establishing a functioning government."],"5450":["In many countries around the world, including China, Japan, and Korea, English is considered to be a global language. This means that it is widely spoken and understood, and is often used as a common language for communication between people who speak different native languages.\\n\\nOne reason that English is used so frequently in these countries is because it is the primary language of many international businesses and organizations. For example, if a company like McDonald's wants to advertise their products to a global audience, they might use English text on their billboards because it is a language that many people around the world can understand.\\n\\nAnother reason that English is used so frequently in these countries is because it is often taught as a second language in schools. This means that many people in these countries have learned how to speak and read English as part of their education.\\n\\nOverall, the use of English text in countries like China, Japan, and Korea reflects the important role that English plays as a global language for communication and business.\\n"],"1105":["Snow melters can be a useful tool for removing snow, but they are not a universally applicable solution. There are several reasons why they may not be used more widely: \n1. Cost: Snow melters can be expensive to purchase and maintain, especially if they are large enough to handle the amount of snow that accumulates in a city. \n2. Energy consumption: Snow melters require a lot of energy to operate, which can be costly and may not be environmentally friendly. \n3. Limited capacity: Snow melters can only melt a certain amount of snow at a time, so they may not be able to keep up with heavy snowfall or large accumulations of snow. \n4. Infrastructure: In order to use a snow melter, a city would need to have the necessary infrastructure in place to transport the melted snow to a drain or other disposal location. This can be costly and logistically challenging. \n5. Environmental concerns: Melting snow can produce runoff that contains pollutants and other contaminants that can end up in rivers and streams. This can be harmful to the environment and may require additional treatment before the runoff can be safely released. \nOverall, while snow melters can be a useful tool in certain situations, they are not always the most practical or cost-effective solution for snow removal."],"128":["Sure!

The hands on the clock seem to be moving slower when you are running, because you are moving past them quickly. It's the same idea with the spaceship and the light. As you are moving very fast, it takes longer for the light to catch up to you, so time appears to slow down. \nDoes that help to explain it a little bit?"],"16432":["Game developers often can take legal action against websites that provide hacks or cheats for their games, and some do. However, it can be difficult to identify the individuals responsible for creating and distributing these hacks and cheats, and it can be challenging to effectively shut down websites that are distributing them. Additionally, some of these websites may be located in countries where it is difficult for game developers to pursue legal action.\n\nAnother reason why game developers may not take legal action is that it can be time-consuming and costly to do so. It may not always be practical or cost-effective for a game developer to pursue legal action against websites that are distributing hacks or cheats, especially if the hacks and cheats are not having a significant impact on the game or the game's community.\n\nIn summary, while game developers can take legal action against websites that provide hacks or cheats for their games, it can be difficult to do so and may not always be practical or cost-effective."],"14556":["Drinking Coke Zero will not directly make you fat, but it's important to remember that no food or drink is completely without calories or sugar.

Evolution doesn't \"know\" when it needs to adapt to a change in the environment in the same way that you or I might know something. Instead, evolution is a process that happens over many generations and is driven by the interaction between living organisms and their environment. When the environment changes, some organisms might have traits that help them survive and reproduce better than others. These organisms are more likely to pass on their traits to their offspring, and over time, the population of organisms can change to better suit the new environment. So, in a way, evolution is like a process of trial and error, where the traits that work best in a given environment are passed on to future generations.

They are similar to radio waves, but they have a shorter wavelength and a higher frequency. Inside the microwave oven, there is a magnetron, which is a device that generates microwaves. When you turn on the microwave, the magnetron takes electricity from the power outlet and uses it to create microwaves, which it sends into the cooking chamber. The microwaves bounce around inside the cooking chamber and pass through the food. When they pass through the food, they cause the water, fat, and sugar molecules inside the food to vibrate and move around very fast. This movement creates heat, and that is how the microwave cooks the food. As for why heavier or denser items take longer to cook in the microwave, it has to do with how much water, fat, and sugar they contain. Foods with more of these substances will absorb more microwaves and therefore heat up faster. Foods with less of these substances will absorb fewer microwaves and take longer to heat up. That's why it might take longer to cook a frozen pizza than a bowl of soup, for example."],"1391":["I'm sorry, but I am unable to access the URL you provided or any other external information.

According to the uncertainty principle, it is impossible to know both the exact position and the exact momentum (speed and direction) of a particle at the same time. \nThis might seem strange, but imagine trying to measure the position of a small insect flying around a room. If you want to know exactly where the insect is, you might try to shine a flashlight on it. But as soon as you shine the light on the insect, you change its momentum (because the light has energy, and when it hits the insect it gives some of that energy to the insect). So now you know where the insect is, but you don't know its momentum as well as you did before. On the other hand, if you don't shine any light on the insect, you might be able to figure out its momentum (for example, by clapping your hands and trying to chase it), but now you don't know its position as well as you did before. \nThe uncertainty principle tells us that there is always a trade-off between knowing the position and knowing the momentum of a particle. The more precisely we know one of these things, the less precisely we can know the other. This is a fundamental aspect of the nature of the universe at very small scales, and it has important implications for how we understand the world around us."],"14752":["Launching a rocket into space is more difficult than launching an airplane because rockets have to travel much higher and faster.\n\nAirplanes only need to fly through the Earth's atmosphere, which is the layer of air around our planet. But rockets have to leave the Earth's atmosphere and travel all the way to space, where there is no air at all.\n\nTo do this, rockets need a lot of powerful engines and fuel. The engines have to burn very hot and produce a lot of force to lift the rocket off the ground and into the air. And the rocket needs enough fuel to keep the engines burning for a long time, so it can reach the high speeds and heights it needs to get to space.\n\nRockets also have to be built very carefully and tested thoroughly to make sure they can withstand the extreme conditions of space travel. This includes being able to withstand the intense heat and pressure of the launch, as well as the freezing cold and vacuum of space.\n\nAll of these factors make launching a rocket much more complex and difficult than launching an airplane.

This is because the weight of the blades is evenly distributed around the rotor, which helps the turbine stay upright and steady in the wind. \nFinally, three blades are less noisy than fewer blades. This is because the three blades produce a more consistent, rhythmic sound as they spin, which is less annoying to people who live near wind turbines. \nSo overall, wind turbines have three blades because they are more efficient, stable, and quiet than fewer blades."],"16816":["It looks like you are talking about websites that use a technique called \"responsive design.\" Responsive design is a way for websites to automatically adjust their layout and design to look good on different devices, such as laptops, tablets, and phones.\n\nThe reason that some websites do this is to make it easier for people to use the website on different devices. For example, if you are using a phone to browse the internet, you might want to see the website in a different way than if you were using a laptop. By using responsive design, the website can automatically adjust itself to look good and be easy to use on different devices.\n\nHere's a simple way to explain it: Imagine that you have a toy box and you want to put all of your toys inside. If you have a small toy box, you might have to stack the toys on top of each other to make them all fit. But if you have a bigger toy box, you can spread the toys out and they will all fit comfortably. That's kind of like what responsive design does for websites - it adjusts the layout so that everything fits comfortably on different devices."],"9684":["Mortgages are structured this way because it allows the lender to collect more interest in the beginning of the loan, while the borrower is paying off the principal (the amount borrowed) gradually over time. This is known as a \"front-loaded\" interest structure.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this structure is that it can make the monthly payments more affordable for the borrower. If the borrower had to pay off a large portion of the principal right away, the monthly payments would be much higher and might be difficult to afford. By spreading out the payments over a longer period of time and including more interest in the early payments, the lender can make the monthly payments more manageable for the borrower.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that the amount of interest you pay on a mortgage can vary depending on the terms of the loan and the interest rate. A loan with a higher interest rate will result in higher monthly payments, and more of those payments will be going towards interest in the beginning. You can shop around and compare different loans to find one that works best for your budget and financial situation."],"16454":["Drowning is when a person has too much water in their lungs and they can't breathe. To drown, a person needs to have a lot of water in their lungs. It's possible for a person to drown by swallowing just a mouthful of water, but it's not very common. Most people drown because they fall into a body of water and are unable to get back to the surface to take a breath. If a person falls into deep water and is not able to swim to the surface, they will eventually inhale water and drown.\n\nIt's important to be careful around water and to always be aware of your surroundings when you're near it. If you're not a strong swimmer, it's a good idea to wear a life jacket or floatation device when you're near deep water. It's also a good idea to have someone with you who can help you if you get into trouble."],"9438":["Before humans developed language, they likely thought in a way that was similar to how animals think today. This means that they probably used their senses (such as sight, smell, and hearing) to perceive the world around them, and they used their brains to process this information and make decisions based on it. For example, if an early human saw a lion, they might use their brains to think about how to stay safe, such as by running away or finding a place to hide.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's important to note that humans are unique in their ability to use language, which allows us to communicate with each other and think about abstract concepts in a way that other animals cannot. Language has played a key role in human evolution and has allowed us to develop complex societies, create new technologies, and understand the world around us in ways that were not possible without it. So, while it's difficult to say exactly how early humans thought before they developed language, we can be sure that their thought processes were different from ours in many ways."],"10687":["Sadism and schadenfreude are both emotions that involve feeling pleasure or enjoyment in the suffering of others. However, they are different in a few key ways.\r\n\r\nSadism refers to the pleasure that someone gets from causing pain or suffering to others. For example, a sadistic person might enjoy hitting someone or causing them to feel physical pain.\r\n\r\nSchadenfreude, on the other hand, refers to the pleasure that someone gets from seeing or hearing about someone else's suffering or misfortune. For example, if someone falls down and hurts themselves, someone experiencing schadenfreude might feel happy about it or find it funny.\r\n\r\nOne way to think about the difference between the two is that sadism involves actively causing harm to others, while schadenfreude involves feeling pleasure in something that has already happened to someone else.\r\n\r\nHere's an example to help illustrate the difference:\r\n\r\nImagine that two people are playing a game of soccer and one person trips and falls to the ground. The person who tripped might feel pain and embarrassment.\r\n\r\nIf the person who tripped is being sadistic, they might feel happy or satisfied that they caused the other person to fall and feel pain.\r\n\r\nIf the person who tripped is experiencing schadenfreude, they might feel happy or amused that the other person fell and is feeling pain, even if they didn't cause it themselves.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!

The amount of weight you gain from eating a certain amount of food depends on the number of calories in the food and how many calories your body uses. Calories are a unit of energy that is found in food. When you eat food, your body uses the calories in the food to fuel your body's activities, such as moving, thinking, and growing. If you eat more calories than your body needs, your body will store the extra calories as fat, which can lead to weight gain. On the other hand, if you eat fewer calories than your body needs, your body will use stored fat as energy, which can lead to weight loss. So, to answer your question, it is possible to gain weight if you eat a pound of food, especially if the food is high in calories and you do not burn those calories through physical activity. However, it is also possible to eat a pound of food and not gain weight, depending on the number of calories in the food and how active you are."],"2280":["Sure, I can help clarify the differences between satire, sarcasm, and parody. Satire is a form of humor that uses wit to make fun of or criticize something, usually a person, institution, or idea. Satire is often used to expose flaws or shortcomings in a humorous way, in the hopes of inspiring change. Sarcasm is a type of irony that involves saying or writing something that is the opposite of what you really mean, usually in a mocking or sarcastic tone. Sarcasm is often used to make fun of something or someone, or to convey a sense of irony or absurdity. Parody is a type of humor that involves imitating or exaggerating the characteristics of something, often for the purpose of making fun of it. A parody can be of a person, an institution, an idea, or even a whole genre of art or literature. To summarize, satire and sarcasm are both forms of humor that involve making fun of something or someone, but satire often has a more serious or critical purpose, while sarcasm is more often used just to be amusing or sarcastic. Parody, on the other hand, involves imitating something in order to make fun of it."],"12206":["Twitter is considered a reliable source for news because it allows people to get information and updates from a variety of sources in real-time. This can be especially useful during breaking news situations, when traditional news sources may not have all the latest details. Additionally, many journalists and news organizations use Twitter to share updates, articles, and other information, which can make it a useful tool for staying informed. While it is true that anyone can use Twitter and post whatever they want, news organizations and journalists are generally careful to verify the information they share before posting it. So, in short, Twitter can be a useful source of information, but it's important to be aware of the potential for misinformation and to check multiple sources when looking for news."],"1389":["There are several reasons why sleeping medication may not work consistently. Here are a few possible explanations: \n1. Different people may have different responses to the same medication. Some people may be more sensitive to the effects of sleeping medication, while others may be less sensitive. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as differences in body size, age, and genetics. \n2. The effectiveness of sleeping medication can depend on the dose. If you are not taking the correct dose for your body, the medication may not work as well. It's important to follow the dosage instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist. \n3. The effectiveness of sleeping medication can be affected by other medications you are taking. Some medications can interact with sleeping medication and alter its effectiveness. If you are taking other medications, it's important to tell your doctor or pharmacist about them. \n4. Your sleep habits and environment can also affect the effectiveness of sleeping medication. If you have poor sleep hygiene (e.g., if you are using electronic devices before bed or sleeping in a noisy or brightly lit room), the medication may not work as well. \n5. Finally, it's possible that you may have developed a tolerance to the medication. This means that over time, your body may become used to the medication and it may not work as well. If you think this may be the case, it's important to talk to your doctor about possible alternative treatments."],"8350":["Salt is a preservative in food because it helps to prevent the growth of bacteria. Bacteria need water to grow, and salt helps to remove water from the environment. When salt is added to food, it draws out some of the water and creates an environment that is less hospitable for bacteria to grow. This can help to extend the shelf life of the food.\r\n\r\nAs for the second part of your question, it is possible for food to become less salty over time. This can happen if the food is stored in a humid environment, as the salt may dissolve in the water and be absorbed by the food. It can also happen if the food is cooked or processed in a way that removes some of the salt. However, in general, the salt content of food does not change significantly over time unless it is actively being removed."],"7368":["Throughout history, there have been many reasons why commanders have fought in the front lines. One reason is to boost morale. When a commander fights alongside their troops, it can inspire and motivate the soldiers to fight harder and more courageously. Additionally, a commander who fights in the front lines can better understand the situation on the battlefield and make more informed decisions about how to direct their troops.However, it is also true that fighting in the front lines can be very risky and makes it easier for the enemy to kill the commander. This is especially true if the commander has no special training or protection. Therefore, it is important for commanders to balance the need to inspire and lead their troops with the need to protect themselves. In some cases, commanders may choose to fight in the front lines, while in other cases, they may choose to stay back and direct the battle from a safer position."],"16979":["Feminism is called feminism because it is a movement that advocates for the rights and equality of women. The term \"feminism\" comes from the Latin word \"femina,\" which means woman. The goal of feminism is to create a world where women and men are treated as equals and have the same opportunities and rights. This includes the right to vote, the right to education, the right to hold leadership positions, and the right to be treated with respect and dignity.\n\nWhile it is true that feminists believe in equality between men and women, the term \"equalism\" suggests that everyone is already equal, which is not the case. There are still many systems, policies, and cultural practices that discriminate against and disadvantage women, and feminism aims to challenge and change these things.\n\nIt is important to note that feminism is not about making women superior to men. Rather, it is about creating a society in which men and women are treated as equals and have the same opportunities to succeed and thrive."],"16955":["Sure! I'd be happy to help explain APR to you.\n\nAPR stands for \"Annual Percentage Rate.\" It's a number that tells you how much it will cost you to borrow money on a credit card each year. It's expressed as a percentage, so if your APR is 20%, that means it will cost you 20 cents for every dollar you borrow.\n\nAPR is important because it helps you compare the cost of borrowing money on different credit cards. For example, if one credit card has an APR of 20% and another has an APR of 15%, the one with the lower APR will be cheaper to use.\n\nIt's important to remember that APR is only one factor to consider when choosing a credit card. You should also think about things like fees, rewards, and other features that the credit card offers.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"9480":["Financing a car through a bank is generally cheaper than financing through a dealership because banks usually offer lower interest rates. This is because banks typically have more money to lend, so they can afford to charge lower interest rates to attract borrowers.\r\n\r\nDealerships may have lower advertised interest rates, but they often add on other fees and charges that can make the overall cost of financing higher. These hidden fees can include things like an origination fee, which is a charge for processing the loan, or a documentation fee, which is a charge for preparing and filing the necessary paperwork.\r\n\r\nIn general, it's a good idea to shop around and compare offers from different lenders, including banks and dealerships, to find the best financing deal for your car. It's also a good idea to read the fine print and understand all of the fees and charges that are included in the financing offer, so you know exactly what you're paying for."],"5865":["There are several techniques that can be used to remove or reduce vocals from a song to create an instrumental version. One common method is to use software that can analyze the audio and identify the frequencies that are associated with the vocals. The software can then attempt to remove or reduce these frequencies, leaving the instrumental parts of the song intact.\\n\\nAnother method is to use \"phase cancellation,\" which involves creating a \"mirror image\" of the original audio file and then combining it with the original. When the two signals are combined, the vocals (which are present in both signals) will cancel each other out, leaving only the instrumental parts of the song.\\n\\nIt's important to note that these methods are not always 100% effective, and it can be difficult to completely remove vocals without also affecting the other instruments. In some cases, you may still be able to hear a faint trace of the vocals, or the instrumental version may not sound quite the same as the original."],"4096":["Linux is a specific type of operating system, like Windows or MacOS.

Instead, they are in a state of suspended animation, which means that their bodies are in a state of reduced metabolic activity and they do not experience the normal physical effects of time passing. In this state, their bodies are not moving, so they are not at risk of developing bed sores. \nHibernation is a natural process that some animals go through in order to conserve energy during times when food is scarce. It involves a reduction in body temperature, heart rate, and other metabolic processes. Humans do not have the ability to naturally hibernate, but scientists are studying the possibility of artificially inducing a state of suspended animation in humans for medical purposes, such as during surgery or for long-term space travel. However, this is still an area of research and it is not currently possible for humans to enter a state of hibernation."],"4307":["When you invest in stocks, you are buying a small ownership stake in a company. The company uses the money it receives from selling its stocks to grow and improve its business. As the company's profits and value increase, the value of your stock may also increase.\\n\\nThere are a few ways that you can make money from investing in stocks:\\n\\nCapital gains: If you buy a stock at a low price and sell it later at a higher price, you can earn a profit, which is called a capital gain.\\n\\nDividends: Some companies pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. Dividends are typically paid out on a regular basis, such as quarterly or annually.\\n\\nStock splits: When a company's stock becomes more valuable, it may \"split\" the stock into multiple shares. For example, if a company has a 2-for-1 stock split, you would receive an additional share of stock for every share you own. This does not directly increase the value of your investment, but it can make it easier for you to sell your stocks if you decide to do so.\\n\\nIt's important to note that investing in stocks carries risk, and there is no guarantee that you will make money. It's important to do your research and invest wisely."],"15207":["Mitt Romney is a politician who runs for public office. When a person runs for public office, they often need to raise money to pay for their campaign. This can include things like hiring staff, creating advertisements, and traveling to meet with voters. Even if a person is very wealthy, they may not have enough money to pay for all of the expenses that come with running a campaign. Additionally, campaign finance laws in the United States place limits on how much money an individual can contribute to their own campaign. As a result, candidates often need to ask for donations from other people to help fund their campaign."],"490":["Correlation refers to a relationship between two things, where one thing (called a \"variable\") might have an effect on the other. For example, if you eat more ice cream, you might get more cavities. In this case, there is a correlation between eating ice cream and getting cavities, because one thing (eating ice cream) seems to be related to the other (getting cavities). \nCausation refers to a relationship where one thing (the cause) directly causes another thing (the effect). In the example of eating ice cream and getting cavities, the causation would be that eating ice cream directly causes you to get cavities. \nHowever, just because two things are correlated does not mean that one thing is causing the other. There might be other factors that are causing both things to happen. For example, if you eat more ice cream and also brush your teeth less often, you might get more cavities. In this case, the lack of tooth brushing is causing the cavities, not the ice cream. \nSo, to sum up: correlation means that two things seem to be related, but causation means that one thing directly causes the other. Just because two things are correlated does not necessarily mean that one thing is causing the other."],"5976":["When people talk about maturity in the context of personality, thought processes, and understanding of a given subject, they are usually referring to how well-developed and advanced someone's thoughts and behaviors are.

They stand in front of the orchestra and use hand gestures and facial expressions to help the musicians know when to start playing and when to stop. The conductor also helps the orchestra play together as a group by keeping everyone in time with each other. Think of the conductor like a traffic cop. They help everyone know when to go and when to stop, and they make sure everyone stays in their own lanes so that everyone gets where they need to go safely. During a performance, the conductor will usually have a copy of the music that the orchestra is playing. They will look at the music and then give cues to the musicians to help them know when to start playing and when to stop. The conductor will also make sure that the orchestra is playing at the right speed and with the right dynamics (loud or soft). In addition to leading the orchestra, the conductor is also responsible for rehearsing the music with the orchestra before the performance. They will work with the musicians to make sure that everyone knows their parts and that the music sounds good. The conductor is also responsible for choosing the music that the orchestra will play and for making sure that the orchestra is ready for each performance. I hope this helps!

The wall is called the \"Green Monster\" because it is painted green and is a towering obstacle for batters trying to hit home runs. In baseball, each team gets to decide the dimensions of their home field, including the height and shape of the outfield wall. The Red Sox have chosen to have a high wall in left field at Fenway Park, which makes it harder for batters to hit home runs over it. Other teams have chosen different dimensions for their fields, and some have much lower walls or no walls at all. It is allowed for teams to have different dimensions for their fields because it can create a unique home field advantage for each team. The Red Sox, for example, have an advantage at Fenway Park because the Green Monster makes it harder for opposing players to hit home runs. However, the Red Sox may have a disadvantage when they play on other teams' fields, where the walls may be lower or not present at all. Overall, the dimensions of a baseball field, including the height and shape of the outfield wall, are an important part of the game and can affect how teams play and score runs."],"10198":["Contrails, or condensation trails, are clouds that form behind airplanes when they fly through the sky.

This limit is determined by the properties of the material the knife or metal is made of and the manufacturing process used to create it. \nTo understand why there is a limit to how sharp a knife or piece of metal can be, it's helpful to think about what happens when we try to sharpen a knife. When we sharpen a knife, we use a tool (like a sharpening stone or a honing rod) to remove small amounts of metal from the blade of the knife. This process helps to create a very sharp edge on the knife, but it also makes the blade thinner and weaker. \nAs we continue to sharpen the knife, the blade will eventually become so thin and weak that it will break or chip when we try to use it. This is the limit of how sharp the knife can be. \nIn general, the sharper a knife is, the more delicate and fragile it is. So, while it's possible to make a knife very sharp, it's also important to find a balance between sharpness and durability."],"8044":["Gerrymandering is a way that politicians can try to change the boundaries of voting districts in a way that helps them win elections. It's a way of manipulating the system to try to get an unfair advantage.\r\n\r\nImagine a state with 100 people who are going to vote in an election. The state is divided into 10 voting districts, with 10 people in each district. If the politicians want to make it easier for their party to win, they might redraw the lines of the districts so that all the people who usually vote for the other party are put into just one district. Now, that district has all the people who usually vote for the other party, and the other nine districts have more people who usually vote for the politicians' party. This makes it easier for the politicians' party to win, because they have a lot more districts where they have a majority of the votes.\r\n\r\nGerrymandering is a way for politicians to try to control the outcome of an election by changing the way the voting districts are drawn. It can be a controversial practice, because it can give some parties an unfair advantage over others."],"4024":["Postmodernism is a complicated and difficult to define philosophical and artistic movement that developed in the second half of the 20th century. One way to understand it is to think about it as a way of thinking and creating that is skeptical of certain ideas and beliefs that have been accepted as true in the past. For example, postmodernists often question grand narratives or \"big stories\" that try to explain everything in the world and how it works, such as the belief in progress or the idea that there is one true way of looking at things. One way that postmodernism has been expressed in art and literature is by \"breaking the fourth wall,\" which means directly addressing the audience as if they are part of the story. This can be used to challenge the idea that there is a clear separation between the \"real\" world and the world of the story, and to question the role of the artist or creator in shaping how the story is told and understood. It's important to note that postmodernism is a broad and complex movement, and there are many different ways that it has been understood and expressed. So while \"breaking the fourth wall\" is one way that postmodernism has been expressed, it is just one aspect of a much larger and more varied set of ideas and practices."],"6329":["The Paris Agreement is an international agreement that was signed in 2015 by nearly every country in the world. It is a set of rules and goals that countries agree to follow in order to try to slow down and eventually stop climate change. Climate change is a problem because the Earth is getting warmer and this is causing lots of problems, like more heatwaves, storms, and rising sea levels.The Paris Agreement has two main goals. The first goal is to try to keep the Earth from getting more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution. The second goal is to try to keep the amount of greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide) in the air as low as possible. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which makes the Earth warmer.To help reach these goals, countries agreed to take steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they produce. They also agreed to help each other out by providing money and other types of support to countries that need help reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.The Paris Agreement is very important because climate change is a big problem that affects everyone. If we don't do something about it now, it will only get worse. By working together and following the rules in the Paris Agreement, we can hopefully slow down and eventually stop climate change."],"9475":["Apple Inc., the technology company, does not own the rights to the music of the Beatles, a British rock band. However, Apple Corps, a company founded by the Beatles in 1968, has had a long and complicated relationship with Apple Inc.\r\n\r\nApple Corps was originally created as a holding company for the business interests of the Beatles, including their record label, music publishing, and other ventures. In the 1980s, Apple Corps sued Apple Inc., claiming that the technology company's use of the apple logo and the name \"Apple\" for its computers and other products was an infringement of Apple Corps' trademark. The two companies eventually settled the lawsuit and entered into a licensing agreement that allowed Apple Inc. to use the apple logo and the name \"Apple\" in exchange for paying a royalty to Apple Corps.\r\n\r\nAs for the royalties for the Beatles' music, these are typically paid to the owners of the copyright for the songs, which is usually the songwriter or their music publishing company. In the case of the Beatles, the songs were mostly written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, so they would be entitled to receive royalties for their compositions. The ownership of the copyright for a song can also be transferred or sold to another person or company."],"9513":["A handshake is a way of greeting someone or saying goodbye by shaking hands. It is a common way to show respect and goodwill towards someone you are meeting or leaving.\r\n\r\nWhen meeting someone for the first time, it is generally a good idea to offer your hand for a handshake. You can extend your hand and say \"Nice to meet you\" or \"How do you do?\" as a way of introducing yourself. It is also a good idea to look the person in the eye and smile when you shake hands.\r\n\r\nThere are some situations when it is not appropriate to shake hands. For example, if you are sick or have an injury that might be contagious, it is best to avoid shaking hands to prevent spreading any illness. In some cultures, it is also not customary to shake hands with members of the opposite sex, so it is important to be aware of and respect these customs.\r\n\r\nIn general, if you are not sure whether it is appropriate to shake hands, you can simply wait and see if the other person extends their hand first.

This process can cause the slug to become dehydrated and can eventually kill it. The salt can also damage the slug's skin, causing it to become irritated and leading to the appearance of melting. However, it's important to note that slugs do not actually melt when they come into contact with salt. They are simply reacting to the harmful effects of the salt on their bodies."],"3188":["Mirrors work by reflecting light. When light bounces off of an object, it can be reflected in many different directions. When light bounces off a mirror, it reflects back in the same direction that it came from. Imagine you are standing in front of a mirror. The light from the room bounces off of you and hits the mirror. The mirror reflects the light back in the same direction that it came from, so the light travels back to your eyes. That's why you can see yourself in the mirror. Not everything reflects light in the same way. Some objects, like mirrors, are very good at reflecting light. These are called \"reflective\" surfaces. Other objects, like paper or cloth, are not very good at reflecting light. These are called \"absorptive\" surfaces. That's why you can see your reflection in a mirror, but you can't see it in a piece of paper or a shirt."],"11200":["Diplomatic immunity is a rule that helps foreign diplomats do their jobs in another country. It means that they are not supposed to get in trouble for things that they do in their job. It helps them to be able to talk to people in the other country and do what they need to do without worrying about being arrested or punished. This is important because if diplomats were afraid of getting in trouble, they might not be able to do their job as well, and it could be harder for different countries to talk to each other and work together. However, diplomatic immunity is not a free pass to do whatever they want. If a diplomat breaks a serious law, like hurting someone, they can still be punished."],"1025":["A bong is a type of smoking device that is used to smoke substances such as marijuana or tobacco. It is made up of a bowl, a stem, and a chamber filled with water. When you light the substance in the bowl and inhale through the stem, the smoke travels down through the stem and into the chamber of water. \nThe water in the bottom of the bong serves several purposes. First, it helps to filter the smoke as it passes through the water, which can help to cool the smoke and make it less harsh on the throat and lungs. Second, the water helps to remove some of the tar and other impurities from the smoke, which can make the smoke less harmful to the body. \nThe water in the bong does not increase the amount of weed fumes that are produced. Instead, it helps to filter and cool the smoke as it is inhaled.

Like any investment, it carries certain risks and may not always perform as well as other investments. One reason gold may not be a good investment is that it does not provide any income. Unlike stocks or bonds, gold does not pay dividends or interest. This means that if you invest in gold, you will not be earning any money on your investment unless you sell it for a higher price than you paid. Another reason is that gold is not very useful in and of itself. It does not have any practical applications, so its value is largely based on supply and demand. This means that its price can fluctuate a lot, and it may not always be a stable investment. Finally, gold is a physical asset, which means it requires storage and insurance, and it can be lost or stolen. This adds additional costs to owning gold, which can eat into any potential gains.

Each pilot is trained to fly the plane and handle different situations that may arise during a flight. If one pilot becomes incapacitated for any reason, the other pilot can take control of the plane and safely land it.\r\n\r\nThe steering wheel, or yoke, is used by the pilots to control the direction of the plane. The yoke is attached to the plane's rudder, which is a large hinged surface on the back of the plane that controls its direction. The pilots use the yoke to steer the plane left or right, or to make it go up or down.\r\n\r\nHaving two pilots allows for better communication and teamwork during a flight. The pilots can discuss and make decisions together, and each pilot can take breaks while the other pilot flies the plane. This helps to reduce fatigue and ensure that the pilots are able to stay alert and focused throughout the flight.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps to explain why large commercial planes have two pilots and two steering wheels!"],"7115":["A water filter is a device that is used to remove impurities from water. It works by using a physical barrier, a chemical process, or a biological process to remove the unwanted substances from the water. The water filter can be used to make tap water safer to drink by removing things like bacteria, parasites, and other contaminants that can cause illness.Imagine that you have a bucket of dirty water and you want to make it clean enough to drink. You could use a water filter to help you do this. You would pour the dirty water through the water filter, and the filter would trap the dirt and other impurities in it. The clean water would then come out the other side of the filter and you could drink it without worrying about getting sick.In Italy, you can use a water filter called a \"bobble\" to make the tap water safer to drink. The bobble filter works by using a special type of material to remove impurities from the water as it passes through the filter. You can use the bobble filter to fill up a bottle of water and take it with you wherever you go, or you can use it to filter the water in your home or office."],"1218":["Many people in the African-American community have names that are unique and may not have a traditional English or European origin. These names can be a combination of traditional African names, shortened versions of longer names, and sometimes names that are created by the person or family naming the child. Some of these names may sound modern because they are not as common or as well known as more traditional names. It is important to remember that people of all cultures and backgrounds have the right to choose their own names and that the history and meaning of a person's name is personal and can be important to them. It is not appropriate to make judgments or comments based on someone's name."],"10719":["It's true that people can forget memories from things like being knocked out or having Alzheimer's disease, and they can also forget people and events. However, it's usually more difficult for people to forget how to communicate in a language that they have learned and used for a long period of time. This is because the ability to speak and understand a language is often stored in a different part of the brain than other types of memories.\r\n\r\nWhen we learn a language, we don't just memorize a list of words and their meanings. Instead, we learn the rules and patterns of the language, and we practice using it to communicate with others. This helps our brain to build connections and pathways that allow us to speak and understand the language more easily.\r\n\r\nThink of it like a bike path. When you first learn to ride a bike, it might be a little difficult to balance and pedal. But the more you practice, the easier it becomes. Your brain is creating a \"pathway\" that it can use to ride the bike more easily. It's the same with language. The more you practice using a language, the more your brain creates pathways that allow you to speak and understand it more easily.\r\n\r\nSo, even if you forget some other things, it's usually harder to forget a language that you have learned and used for a long time because your brain has built up strong pathways for using that language."],"11133":["Sure!

When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, some of them may die, while others may survive because they have developed ways to resist the drugs. These surviving bacteria can then multiply and pass on their resistance to other bacteria.\\n\\nAnother way that bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics is through the transfer of genetic material. Bacteria can share pieces of DNA with each other, including pieces that contain genes for antibiotic resistance. This means that even bacteria that were not originally resistant to a particular antibiotic can become resistant if they receive the right genes from other bacteria.\\n\\nFinally, bacteria can also develop resistance to antibiotics through the process of mutation. Mutation is a random change that can occur in the DNA of a bacterium. If a mutation happens to give a bacterium a way to resist an antibiotic, that bacterium can survive and multiply, passing on the resistance to its offspring.\\n\\nSo, in summary, bacteria can become more resistant to antibiotics through natural selection, the transfer of genetic material, and mutation. This can make it harder to treat infections with these drugs, and sometimes stronger antibiotics are needed to kill the bacteria."],"11312":["Oscar Pistorius was using the term \"my lady\" as a way to show respect to the person who was asking him the question, who happened to be a woman.

One of the main issues at the heart of the turmoil is the relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China. Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous territory that was previously a British colony, and it has its own legal system, government, and way of life that is quite different from the rest of China. However, it is now part of China, and many people in Hong Kong are concerned about the increasing influence of the Chinese government over their affairs and the erosion of their autonomy. In recent years, the Chinese government has introduced a number of laws and policies that many people in Hong Kong believe are a threat to their freedoms and way of life. This has led to widespread protests and demonstrations, as well as clashes with the police and other authorities. The situation has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has further strained relations between the people of Hong Kong and the government. The political turmoil in Hong Kong is a big problem because it has caused a great deal of tension and conflict within the territory, and it has also led to strained relations between Hong Kong and mainland China. It is a complex and fluid situation that is still evolving, and it is not clear how it will ultimately be resolved."],"9270":["A black hole is a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. When a star dies, it can collapse and become a black hole if it has enough mass.\r\n\r\nThe singularity of a black hole is a point in space where the mass of the black hole is concentrated. It is so small and dense that the laws of physics as we know them break down. The event horizon is the boundary around the black hole beyond which nothing can escape.\r\n\r\nWhen a star collapses to form a black hole, the singularity and event horizon are not visible because they are hidden inside the black hole. The star itself will also be invisible, because the black hole absorbs all light and matter that comes near it. However, we can still detect the presence of a black hole through its effects on nearby objects, such as stars or gas clouds."],"11678":["In the world of physics, there are certain things that can behave like both a wave and a particle. This idea is known as wave-particle duality.\r\n\r\nImagine that you are standing on a beach and you see a wave coming towards you. The wave moves through the water, but it also carries energy. You can see the wave and you can feel the energy of the wave, but the wave itself is not a solid object.\r\n\r\nNow imagine that you are playing catch with a friend. You throw a ball to your friend, and they catch it. The ball is a solid object that you can see and touch. It also has energy because it was moving when you threw it.\r\n\r\nWave-particle duality is the idea that some things can behave like both waves and particles. For example, light is a type of energy that can behave like a wave or a particle. When light is behaving like a wave, it can move through space and carry energy, just like a wave in the water. But when light is behaving like a particle, it can be seen and touched, just like a ball.\r\n\r\nDoes that help make sense of wave-particle duality?"],"1141":["Fish need a certain balance of salt and other minerals in their bodies to survive. Freshwater fish have evolved to live in water that has a lower concentration of salt, while saltwater fish have evolved to live in water that has a higher concentration of salt. \nWhen a freshwater fish is placed in saltwater, the extra salt in the water can cause problems for the fish's body. The fish's cells will try to balance out the salt concentration by taking in more water, which can cause the fish to swell up. At the same time, the fish's cells will also try to get rid of the extra salt by releasing more water, which can cause the fish to lose too much water and become dehydrated. \nOn the other hand, when a saltwater fish is placed in freshwater, the lack of salt can also cause problems for the fish's body. The fish's cells will try to balance out the salt concentration by taking in more salt, which can cause the fish to lose too much water and become dehydrated. \nSo, while it is possible for some fish to survive in water that is different from what they are used to, it can be difficult for them and may cause problems for their bodies. That's why it's generally best for fish to stay in the type of water that they are adapted to."],"12825":["Branded drinks like Gatorade and Monster are mass produced by using large industrial machines and processes. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works: 1. First, the ingredients for the drink are measured and mixed together in a giant container.

The hot liquid is then poured into a machine called a \"filling machine,\" which fills it into individual bottles or cans. 4. The bottles or cans are then sealed and labeled with the brand's name and other information. 5. The finished drinks are then packaged into boxes and shipped to stores, where they can be bought by customers. This process is repeated many times over to produce a large quantity of the drink. The exact steps and machines used can vary depending on the specific drink and brand, but this is the general idea."],"15354":["There are a few reasons why some Americans may be opposed to universal healthcare. One reason is that some people may be concerned about the cost of universal healthcare and how it would be funded. Universal healthcare would likely require higher taxes, which some people may not want to pay.\n\nAnother reason is that some people may be worried about the quality of care they would receive under a universal healthcare system. Some people may prefer the flexibility and choice that private health insurance can offer, rather than being limited to a specific set of providers or treatments.\n\nFinally, some people may simply prefer the current system, even if it has its problems, because it is what they are used to and they are concerned about change.\n\nOverall, the issue of universal healthcare is complex and there are valid arguments on both sides.

One reason is that the network you are using to connect to the internet may not always be able to provide a consistent, stable connection. For example, if you are using a wireless connection, the strength of the signal can vary depending on factors such as the distance between your device and the router, and the presence of other electronic devices or obstacles that could interfere with the signal. Another reason is that the server or website you are downloading from may not always have a consistent amount of bandwidth available. This can be due to factors such as the number of users accessing the server at the same time, or the amount of traffic on the internet as a whole. Finally, the number of seeds (people who have already downloaded the file and are now uploading it to others) and the number of peers (people who are also downloading the file at the same time) can affect the speed of a torrent download. If there are fewer seeds or peers available, it may take longer to download the file.

It is a book of laws that God gave to the ancient Israelites through Moses, who was a prophet and leader in the Jewish faith. The laws in Leviticus cover a wide range of topics, including how to worship God, how to treat other people, and how to live a holy and pure life.\n\nSome of the laws in Leviticus may seem harsh to modern readers because they are very strict and specific, and they may seem unfamiliar or strange. For example, Leviticus includes laws about what kinds of animals the Israelites could and could not eat, and it also includes rules about sexual conduct and cleanliness.\n\nIt is important to understand that the laws in Leviticus were given to the Israelites as part of their covenant, or agreement, with God. These laws were meant to help the Israelites live in a way that was pleasing to God and that demonstrated their faith in Him. The laws in Leviticus were also intended to set the Israelites apart from other nations and to help them maintain their cultural and religious identity.\n\nToday, many people who follow the Christian faith do not believe that the laws in Leviticus are directly applicable to their lives. However, the principles and values behind the laws, such as love, justice, and respect for God and others, are still considered important and are taught in the Bible."],"4335":["Recreational drugs like cocaine can temporarily increase heart rate and blood pressure, which can be harmful to the heart and blood vessels.

It's not completely understood why some people have deja vu experiences, but it's thought to be related to how the brain processes memories. One theory is that deja vu occurs when the brain processes information in a way that makes it feel familiar, even if it's actually new. This could be because of a glitch in the brain's memory system, or because the brain is trying to make sense of something that is confusing or unfamiliar. Another theory is that deja vu might be related to the brain's ability to make predictions about the future. When we encounter a new situation, our brains try to predict what will happen next based on our past experiences. If the new situation is similar to something we've experienced before, our brains might predict what will happen next and create a feeling of familiarity. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that deja vu is caused by a lack of oxygen in the environment. Oxygen is important for the body's cells to function properly, but it is not directly related to deja vu."],"17017":["A silent letter is a letter in a word that is not pronounced when the word is spoken. Silent letters are often used in English spelling to show the relationship between words or to indicate the origin of a word. For example, the \"g\" in \"ghost\" is silent because it is used to show that the word is related to other words like \"ghastly\" and \"ghoul,\" which come from a different language. The \"j\" in \"Django\" is also silent because it is used to indicate that the word comes from a French word. The \"l\" in \"freljord\" is silent because it is used to show that the word is related to other words like \"frost\" and \"freeze,\" which come from a different language.\n\nSilent letters can be tricky because they are not pronounced, but they are still important because they can change the meaning of a word. For example, the word \"knight\" is spelled with a \"k\" but it is not pronounced, so it is not the same as the word \"night,\" which is pronounced with a \"k\" sound. In this way, silent letters can help us understand the history and meanings of words, even if we don't pronounce them when we speak."],"11905":["When you make a bank transaction, the money doesn't move instantly from one account to another.

It's a personal choice whether or not to shave, and there's no right or wrong answer. Some people like to shave every day, while others only shave a few times a week.\n\nHere are some tips for shaving:\n\nUse a sharp razor. A dull razor can pull on your skin and cause irritation.\n\nWet your skin with warm water. This will help to soften the hair and make it easier to shave.\n\nUse a good shaving cream or gel. This will help to protect your skin and provide a smooth surface for the razor to glide over.\n\nShave in the direction of hair growth.

A trust fund is a financial arrangement where a person, called the \"trustee,\" manages money or other assets for the benefit of another person, called the \"beneficiary.\" Trust funds can be set up for many different reasons, such as to provide financial support for a child or to manage someone's assets if they become unable to do so themselves. Here's how trust funds work: Someone, usually called the \"grantor,\" decides to create a trust fund. They might do this to provide financial support for a loved one, or to ensure that their assets are managed in a certain way after they die. The grantor works with a lawyer to create a document called a \"trust agreement.\" This document outlines the terms of the trust fund, including who the trustee and beneficiary will be, how the assets in the trust will be managed, and what the money will be used for. The grantor then transfers assets, such as cash, stocks, or real estate, into the trust fund. These assets become the \"principal\" of the trust. The trustee is responsible for managing the assets in the trust. They might invest the money to try to make it grow, or they might use it to pay for things like the beneficiary's education or living expenses. The beneficiary is the person who will benefit from the trust fund. They might receive regular payments from the trust, or they might have access to the assets in the trust when they reach a certain age. The trust fund continues until it reaches its \"termination date,\" which is usually when the beneficiary reaches a certain age or when the trust's purpose has been achieved. At that point, the trustee will distribute the remaining assets in the trust to the beneficiary or to other people or organizations as specified in the trust agreement. I hope that helps!

This happens because the nucleus of the atom, which is made up of protons and neutrons, is not perfectly balanced. Some atoms, called isotopes, are more stable than others because they have a different number of protons and neutrons in their nucleus. \nWhen an atom is radioactive, it means that the nucleus is unstable and will eventually break apart, or decay. This process releases energy and sometimes particles, such as alpha particles or beta particles, which are types of radiation. \nAt sites like Chernobyl, what is left behind after the radioactive atoms decay is called nuclear waste. This waste is still radioactive and can be dangerous to people and the environment if it is not properly stored and handled. \nNot all atoms or isotopes are radioactive. Some isotopes are stable and do not decay, while others are only slightly radioactive and take a very long time to decay. The stability of an atom or isotope depends on the balance of protons and neutrons in its nucleus.

For breakfast, people often eat foods that are high in carbohydrates, such as cereal, toast, or oatmeal. These types of foods can help give us energy to start our day. People also sometimes eat sweeter foods for breakfast, like pastries or fruit, because they can also provide a quick boost of energy. For lunch and dinner, people tend to eat more savory foods, like meat, poultry, or fish, along with vegetables and grains like rice or pasta. These types of foods can help provide the nutrients and energy that our bodies need to function throughout the day.

It's also a good idea to inform your bank, credit card companies, and other important organizations of your new address. This will ensure that you receive any important documents or bills at your new home."],"4420":["Cars and sports games often come out \"a year early\" because the names of the products refer to the year that they are intended to represent. For example, a Nissan 2019 car is intended to represent the style and features that will be popular in the year 2019, even though it is being released in 2018. Similarly, a FIFA 19 game is intended to represent the current state of the sport of soccer in 2019, even though it is being released in 2018. This is just a way of labeling the products and helping people to understand when the product is supposed to represent. It doesn't necessarily mean that the product is being released exactly one year before the year that it is named for."],"9647":["Yes, it is possible to prevent a supercomputer from trying a large number of password guesses by limiting the number of attempts it can make. This is called rate limiting or throttling. Essentially, you can set a rule that says the supercomputer can only try a certain number of guesses per second or per minute, and if it tries to make more guesses than that, it will be blocked or slowed down.\r\n\r\nImagine that you are trying to guess a password that is four digits long (e.g., 1234). If you are only allowed to try one guess per second, it would take you about 11 days to try all 10,000 possible combinations (0000 to 9999). But if you are allowed to try one hundred guesses per second, it would only take you about half an hour to try all 10,000 combinations.\r\n\r\nRate limiting can be an effective way to protect against brute force attacks, which are attacks that involve trying many different combinations of passwords or keys in order to find the correct one. However, it is important to note that there are other ways to crack passwords or codes besides brute force attacks, so rate limiting is not a foolproof solution. It is just one tool that can be used to make it more difficult for attackers to succeed."],"13483":["There are a few reasons why major drug companies have not been producing medical cannabis. First, cannabis is still classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law in the United States, which means it is illegal and considered to have a high potential for abuse. This makes it difficult for major drug companies to produce and sell cannabis products. Second, even in states where medical cannabis is legal, the regulatory environment is complex and can vary greatly from state to state. This can make it difficult for major drug companies to navigate the different regulations and obtain the necessary licenses to produce and sell medical cannabis products. Finally, the market for medical cannabis is still relatively small and is not yet as profitable as other areas of the pharmaceutical industry, so major drug companies may not see it as a worthwhile investment. However, as more and more states legalize medical cannabis and the market grows, it is possible that major drug companies may become more interested in producing and selling these products."],"7347":["Calories are a measure of energy that is found in food. Our bodies need energy to function properly, and we get this energy from the food we eat. Zero calorie foods do not exist, because all foods contain some amount of energy.Soft drinks can be made with artificial sweeteners, which are sweet-tasting substances that do not contain any calories. This is why some soft drinks are labeled as \"zero calorie.\" However, artificial sweeteners are not found naturally in food, and they are not a replacement for the calories that we need in our diet.It is important to eat a healthy and balanced diet that includes a variety of different types of foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and protein sources. This will help ensure that you get the energy and nutrients you need to stay healthy and active."],"3644":["There are a few reasons why the gameplay in a video game might not look as good as the cutscenes: Cutscenes are usually pre-rendered, which means that they are created in advance using very high-quality graphics and animations. This allows the cutscenes to look very detailed and realistic. Gameplay, on the other hand, is usually rendered in real-time, which means that the graphics and animations are being created on the fly as you play the game. This means that the gameplay might not look as smooth or as detailed as the cutscenes, because the computer has to work harder to generate the graphics in real-time. Another reason why the gameplay might not look as good as the cutscenes is that cutscenes are usually shorter and more focused. This means that the developers can put more effort into making each frame of the cutscenes look as good as possible. In contrast, gameplay can be much longer and more varied, which means that the developers have to balance the quality of the graphics with the performance of the game. Finally, some video games simply have a larger budget for creating cutscenes than for creating gameplay. This means that the developers can put more time and effort into making the cutscenes look great, while the gameplay might look a little less polished. Overall, there are many factors that can contribute to the difference in quality between cutscenes and gameplay in a video game. However, as technology improves, it's becoming increasingly common for gameplay to look just as good as cutscenes."],"4035":["When you close your eyes and visualize something, your brain is creating a mental picture using information from your memory. Your memory is like a library of all the things you have seen, heard, and experienced. When you want to visualize something, your brain goes to the library and pulls out the information it needs to create a mental image. It's kind of like how you use your eyes to see things when they are in front of you, except you are using your mind instead of your eyes to see the images."],"920":["Yes, it is possible to not have citizenship of any country. This is called being stateless. \nBeing stateless means that you do not have a nationality, or citizenship, recognized by any country. This can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, you might have been born in a country that does not recognize your parents as citizens, or you might have been stripped of your citizenship by the country you were previously a citizen of. \nBeing stateless can be a very difficult situation, because it means that you do not have the rights and protections that citizenship usually provides. For example, you might not have the right to live and work in any particular country, or to access education, healthcare, and other services. \nIf you find yourself in a situation where you are stateless, it is important to seek help from organizations that can assist you in getting your citizenship recognized by a country or in finding a solution to your situation."],"685":["Birthmarks are spots on the skin that are present at birth or appear shortly after birth. They are very common and can appear anywhere on the body. Some birthmarks are red or pink, while others are brown or black. They can be flat or raised, and some are smooth while others are bumpy. \nThere are two main types of birthmarks: vascular birthmarks and pigmented birthmarks. Vascular birthmarks are caused by abnormal blood vessels in the skin, and they can be red, pink, or purple. Pigmented birthmarks are caused by an excess of pigment in the skin, and they can be brown or black. \nBirthmarks are usually harmless and don't cause any problems. Some people choose to have them removed for cosmetic reasons, but this is not necessary. Most birthmarks fade or disappear on their own over time."],"4618":["Leaves falling off trees in the fall is a natural process that happens every year. It's actually a way that trees get ready for winter, which is a time when there is less sunlight and the weather is colder.\\n\\nDuring the summer, leaves on a tree are busy making food for the tree. They do this by using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make glucose, which is a type of sugar that the tree uses for energy. The leaves have special cells called chloroplasts that contain a green pigment called chlorophyll, which helps them make food using sunlight.\\n\\nAs the days get shorter and the weather gets colder in the fall, the tree starts to prepare for winter. It does this by slowing down the production of chlorophyll and the other chemicals that help the leaves make food. Without chlorophyll, the green color of the leaves fades, and the other colors of the leaves, like yellow and red, become more visible.\\n\\nEventually, the tree stops sending water and nutrients to the leaves, and the leaves stop making food. The leaves then die and fall off the tree. This is why you see so many leaves falling off the trees in the fall.\\n\\nThe reason the tree does this is to save energy. In the winter, there is less sunlight and the weather is colder, so the tree doesn't need as much energy. By shedding its leaves, the tree can save energy that it can use to survive the winter and get ready for the spring. When spring comes, the tree will start growing new leaves, and the cycle will start all over again."],"15898":["Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are ways of generating electricity that come from natural sources and are constantly replenished. They do not produce harmful emissions or waste products, so they are better for the environment than fossil fuels like coal and oil.\n\nCoal is a fossil fuel that is burned to produce electricity. It is relatively cheap to start using, but it is not a clean energy source because it produces greenhouse gases and other pollutants when it is burned. This can contribute to climate change and have negative effects on people's health.\n\nNuclear energy is a way of producing electricity by using the heat that is produced when atoms are split apart, a process called nuclear fission. Nuclear power plants can produce a lot of electricity, but they are expensive to build and can be dangerous if something goes wrong. Nuclear waste, which is produced when nuclear power plants are used, is also very difficult to dispose of safely.\n\nOverall, renewable energy sources are generally seen as the best choice because they do not produce harmful emissions or waste and they are not running out. However, they may not be as reliable as coal or nuclear power in some cases, and they can also be more expensive to set up initially."],"15477":["Blind people use their sense of touch to find braille. They might run their fingers over a surface, like a wall or a sign, until they feel the raised dots that make up braille. Braille is a system of raised dots that can be read with the fingers, and it is used to write and read words. Blind people can learn braille just like sighted people learn to read and write with regular print. They might use braille to read books, signs, or other information. Braille is usually found on signs in public places, like elevators, restrooms, and buildings, so that blind people can find their way around."],"13257":["Fermat's Last Theorem is a famous math problem that was first stated by the mathematician Pierre de Fermat in the 17th century. It says that there are no whole numbers (also called \"integers\") that can be used to solve the equation x^n + y^n = z^n, where x, y, and z are integers and n is a whole number greater than 2. For example, if n is 3, then the equation becomes x^3 + y^3 = z^3. If we try to find some integers that work in this equation, we quickly realize that there are none. For example, we can't find any whole numbers that will make 2^3 + 3^3 equal to anything to the power of 3. Fermat's Last Theorem was a famous math problem because it was very difficult to prove. It took more than 350 years for mathematicians to finally find a proof for it. The proof uses very advanced math concepts, such as elliptic curves and modular forms. To understand the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, it's important to know some basic math concepts, such as prime numbers and the Pythagorean Theorem. If you're not familiar with these concepts, it might be helpful to learn more about them before trying to understand the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem."],"11485":["Wet dreams, also called nocturnal emissions or ejaculatory dreams, are a natural part of the sleep cycle for people with a penis. They happen when a person's body releases sperm and other fluids during sleep.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, your brain sends signals to your body to keep certain muscles relaxed and other muscles active. During sleep, your brain relaxes most of your muscles so you can rest. However, the muscles in the penis do not fully relax. When the muscles in the penis are not fully relaxed, it can sometimes cause an erection.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when people are in deep stages of sleep, they may have an orgasm, which is when the muscles in the penis and other parts of the body contract and release. This can cause a person to have a wet dream. Wet dreams are not necessarily related to what a person is dreaming about and are not necessarily sexual in nature. They are simply a natural part of the sleep cycle for people with a penis."],"6207":["Most drugs are made in laboratories, either by legitimate pharmaceutical companies or by illegal drug manufacturers. Cocaine, for example, is made from coca leaves, which are native to South America. The leaves are processed to extract the cocaine alkaloid, which is then purified to make the final product. Heroin is made from opium, which is a substance that is produced by certain types of poppy plants. The opium is processed to make the final product. The people who make these drugs in laboratories are called chemists, and they use a variety of chemical processes to make the drugs. Sometimes, these drugs are smuggled into countries where they are illegal, and they are sold on the black market or on the darknet."],"4209":["Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, which means it slows down the activity of the brain and the body's systems. When a person drinks alcohol regularly, their brain becomes used to the presence of alcohol and adjusts its function accordingly. When that person then suddenly stops drinking, their brain is no longer receiving the alcohol it has become used to, and it can cause an overactive response in the brain, leading to seizures. Seizures can be a very serious complication of alcohol withdrawal and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. It is important for individuals experiencing alcohol withdrawal to receive medical treatment in order to prevent seizures and other potentially serious complications."],"13262":["Euthanasia is the act of humanely ending an animal's life in order to relieve suffering. When a dog is euthanized, a veterinarian will give the dog a shot of a medicine called a euthanasia solution. This medicine is a very strong anesthetic that causes the dog to fall into a deep sleep and then stop breathing. The process is usually very peaceful and painless for the dog. After the dog has been euthanized, the veterinarian will usually check to make sure that the dog's heart has stopped beating. The dog's body will then be taken care of according to the owner's wishes. Some people choose to have their dog's body cremated, while others may choose to bury their dog's body in a special place. It is important to note that the euthanasia solution is not an overdose of a medicine that is used for other purposes. It is a special medicine that is specifically made for the purpose of humanely ending an animal's life. The dose of the euthanasia solution is carefully calculated to ensure that the dog does not suffer and that the process is as peaceful as possible."],"15013":["When your leg falls asleep, it's because the blood flow to your leg has been cut off temporarily. This can happen when you sit or lie in a position that puts pressure on the nerves that supply blood to your leg. When the blood flow is cut off, your leg muscles don't get the oxygen and nutrients they need, and they start to feel numb and tingly.\n\nThe feeling you describe, like you are being electrocuted, is called paresthesia. Paresthesia is a feeling of tingling, numbness, or pins and needles that is often described as feeling like a mild electric shock. It is a common sensation when blood flow is restored to a body part that has fallen asleep, and it usually goes away on its own after a few minutes.\n\nSo, when your leg falls asleep and you feel like you are being electrocuted, it's just your body's way of telling you that the blood flow to your leg has been cut off and is now being restored. It's a normal and temporary sensation that goes away on its own."],"15900":["A vector is a mathematical object that has both magnitude (size) and direction. It is often used to represent physical quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as velocity or force.\n\nImagine you are trying to describe the location of a toy on a map. You could use two numbers to describe its location, such as \"5 miles north and 3 miles east.\" These two numbers are like the components of a vector. The vector itself is the combination of both the magnitude (5 miles north) and the direction (north).\n\nVectors can be added and subtracted from each other. For example, if you had a vector representing a toy's location and another vector representing the toy's movement, you could add them together to find the toy's new location.\n\nI hope this helps!

This system was used by the British Empire and was adopted by the United States when it was a colony.\n\nThe metric system, on the other hand, is based on the meter, gram, and liter. It is used by most countries in the world, including Europe, South America, and Asia.\n\nThere are several reasons why the United States has not adopted the metric system. One reason is that it would be very expensive and time-consuming to switch to a new system of measurement. This would involve changing the way that products are packaged, labeled, and sold, as well as updating all of the tools and equipment that are used in manufacturing, construction, and other industries.\n\nAnother reason is that the imperial system is well-established and familiar to most people in the United States. It would be difficult for people to learn and use a new system of measurement, especially if they have been using the imperial system their entire lives.\n\nIn the past, there have been efforts to switch to the metric system in the United States, but these efforts have not been successful. It is possible that the United States may eventually adopt the metric system at some point in the future, but it is not clear when or if this will happen."],"9485":["In the United States, it is customary to tip service workers, such as waitstaff at restaurants, bartenders, hairdressers, and so on. The tip is meant to be a way of showing appreciation for the service that you received and to compensate the worker for their time and effort. In some cases, the tip may also be used to help the worker make up for wages that are lower than what is considered fair.\r\n\r\nIn restaurants, it is generally expected that you will leave a tip of 15% to 20% of the total bill, depending on the level of service that you received. This means that if you go to a restaurant and the total cost of your meal is $100, you should leave a tip of between $15 and $20. The exact amount that you leave is up to you, and you can base it on how happy you were with the service.\r\n\r\nTipping is not required by law in the United States, but it is a common practice and is expected in many service industries.

These bacteria can enter the body through cuts, puncture wounds, and other types of injuries. When the bacteria enter the body, they release a toxin that can cause muscle spasms, difficulty swallowing, and other serious symptoms.A tetanus shot is a vaccine that helps to protect against tetanus. It is typically given after an injury to help prevent the bacteria from entering the body and causing an infection. This is because the bacteria that cause tetanus are commonly found in the environment, and it is difficult to predict when you may be exposed to them.It is generally recommended to get a tetanus shot if you have a wound that is deep or dirty, or if you have not had a tetanus shot in the past 10 years. This is because the protection provided by the vaccine decreases over time, and it is important to make sure you are protected against tetanus.It is also a good idea to make sure you are up to date with your tetanus shots even if you have not recently had an injury.

It is funded primarily through a television license fee that is required to be paid by all households, businesses, and organizations in the UK that watch or record live television programs as they are being broadcast. The license fee is set by the UK government and is currently \u00a3157.50 per year for a color TV and \u00a353.00 per year for a black and white TV. The BBC uses the money it receives from the license fee to fund its operations, including the production of television and radio programs, as well as its international news services and websites. It also uses the money to invest in new technology and to maintain and update its infrastructure, such as its studios and transmission equipment. While the BBC is funded primarily through the license fee in the UK, it also generates some income from other sources, such as the sale of BBC programs to other broadcasters around the world and from its commercial arm, BBC Studios, which produces and sells content to a global audience. I hope this helps to clarify how the BBC is funded and how it supports its international presence. If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask."],"12977":["It's important to note that the number of visitors to a website does not necessarily correspond to the number of posts that are made on the site. A visitor is someone who simply visits the website, while a post is a piece of content that is created and shared by a user on the site. Reddit is a very popular website, with over 4 billion visitors per year. This means that a lot of people are visiting the site and looking at the content that is shared there. However, not all of these visitors are necessarily creating new posts or contributing to the site in other ways. Additionally, it's worth noting that not all posts on Reddit are created equal. Some posts are more popular and receive more attention from users, while others may not be as widely viewed or discussed. This is true of any website or social media platform, where some content tends to be more popular than others. So to sum it up, the number of visitors to a website like Reddit does not necessarily have anything to do with the number of posts that are made on the site. Different posts can receive different levels of attention and engagement, regardless of the overall popularity of the site."],"5740":["Yes, counting the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder can help you determine how far away the lightning is.\\n\\nLightning is a flash of electricity that occurs in the sky, often during a thunderstorm. Thunder is the sound that is produced when lightning happens. Because light travels faster than sound, you will see the lightning before you hear the thunder.\\n\\nSo, if you see lightning and start counting the seconds until you hear the thunder, the number of seconds you count will give you a rough estimate of how far away the lightning is. For example, if you count 5 seconds between the lightning and the thunder, the lightning is probably about 1 mile away. This is because it takes about 5 seconds for sound to travel 1 mile.\\n\\nYou can use this method to help you stay safe during a thunderstorm. If the lightning is far away, you might not need to worry as much. But if the lightning is closer, you should be more careful and seek shelter to protect yourself from the storm."],"3507":["Electricity is a form of energy that is transmitted through wires to power homes, businesses, and other devices. When electricity is generated at a power plant, it is sent through power lines to the grid, which is a network of wires that carries the electricity to the places where it is needed. If there is more electricity being generated than is being used at a given time, the excess electricity is not wasted. Instead, it is stored in a variety of ways so that it can be used when it is needed. For example, some power plants use large batteries to store excess electricity, while others use hydroelectric dams to store excess electricity in the form of water that can be released later to generate electricity. Another way that excess electricity can be used is by selling it to other areas that need it. For example, if one area has a lot of excess electricity but another area is experiencing a high demand for electricity, the excess electricity can be sold to the other area to help meet their needs. So, in short, the excess electricity that is generated and is in the grid but not used is not wasted. It is stored or sold to be used at a later time."],"7452":["Genes for poor vision are not necessarily more prominent in the gene pool than genes for good vision. In fact, both types of genes can be found in many different populations.It's important to understand that genes do not determine everything about a person's traits or abilities. Many different factors, including environmental and lifestyle factors, can also play a role in how a person's traits develop.For example, even if a person has a gene that predisposes them to poor vision, they may still be able to see well if they take good care of their eyes and use corrective measures like glasses or contact lenses.Additionally, it's important to remember that not all traits are equally advantageous in all environments. For example, in a environment where good vision is important for hunting and gathering food, individuals with genes for good vision may have an advantage and be more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to the next generation. However, in a different environment where good vision is not as important, genes for poor vision may not have as much of a disadvantage and may still be passed on to the next generation.Overall, the prevalence of certain genes in the gene pool can change over time due to a variety of factors, and it is not always possible to predict how a trait will be affected by these factors."],"9084":["Making an animated movie is a very complex and time-consuming process.

For example, the movie studio needs to pay for things like computer equipment and software to create the animation, as well as expenses like rent for the studio space and electricity to power all the computers.\r\n\r\nAnimated movies can also be expensive because they take a long time to make. It can take years for a team of artists and animators to create all the characters, backgrounds, and other elements of an animated film. This means that the studio needs to pay for all of these people to work on the movie for a long time.\r\n\r\nOverall, making an animated movie is a very expensive process because it involves many different people working together over a long period of time, and there are many different expenses that go into the process."],"9720":["Sure! Cannabis is a plant that contains a chemical called THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). When you consume cannabis, whether it's by smoking, eating, or using it in some other way, the THC goes into your body and into your brain.\r\n\r\nIn your brain, THC attaches to special receptors called cannabinoid receptors. These receptors are found in different parts of the brain and play a role in things like memory, pleasure, and coordination.\r\n\r\nWhen THC attaches to the cannabinoid receptors, it can change the way they work and can affect things like your mood, your appetite, and your ability to concentrate. THC can also make you feel more relaxed or less anxious.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that everyone's body and brain are different, so the effects of cannabis can vary from person to person. Some people may find that cannabis helps them feel better, while others may find that it doesn't have much of an effect or can even make them feel worse. It's also important to be aware that using cannabis can have potential risks and side effects, including impairing your ability to drive or operate heavy machinery."],"1108":["It's natural to have a sense of security and comfort when you know where your important belongings are.

For example, some asthma medications contain bronchodilators, which are drugs that can relax the muscles around the airways in the lungs and make it easier to breathe. This can be beneficial for someone with asthma, but it can also improve athletic performance by allowing the person to take in more oxygen, which can give them an unfair advantage over other athletes. In order to ensure fairness in sports, organizations like the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) have created rules that prohibit the use of certain medications and substances in competition. Asthma medications are allowed, but only if they are used in a way that is necessary for the treatment of asthma and not for the purpose of improving athletic performance. So, if you have asthma and need to use medication to control your symptoms, you can still compete in sports. However, you may need to get special permission to use your medication, and you may need to follow certain rules to make sure you are not using it in a way that could give you an unfair advantage."],"4064":["When we are tired at night or when we wake up in the morning, our muscles can feel tight and sore. Stretching helps to loosen and relax our muscles, which can feel good and help us to feel more awake and alert. Have you ever seen a cat or dog stretch after they wake up from a nap? It's a natural instinct for many animals to stretch when they wake up because it helps them to feel more awake and ready for the day. Humans also have this instinct, which is why stretching can feel so good when we wake up in the morning or after we have been sitting or lying down for a long time."],"15371":["Death panels are a term that some people use to describe a hypothetical group or committee that would make decisions about end-of-life care for people who are very sick or in a lot of pain. However, death panels are not a real thing. They are not something that exists in any country or healthcare system.\n\nEnd-of-life care refers to the medical treatment and support that people receive when they are close to death or have a terminal illness. This type of care is meant to help people feel comfortable and to manage their pain and other symptoms. End-of-life care can involve many different things, such as medication to manage pain and other symptoms, visits from a nurse or doctor, or hospice care.\n\nIt is important to understand that end-of-life care is not the same as assisted suicide or euthanasia, which are when a doctor or nurse helps someone to end their own life. These practices are illegal in many places and are not considered to be part of proper medical care.\n\nI hope this helps to explain what death panels are and what they are not.

Beer is made from four main ingredients: barley, hops, yeast, and water.\n\nTo make beer, the barley is first ground up and soaked in water. This causes the grains to release sugars, which will be used to make the alcohol in the beer. The mixture is then heated, and hops are added to give the beer its flavor and aroma.\n\nNext, the mixture is cooled and yeast is added. The yeast eats the sugars and releases alcohol and carbon dioxide gas as a byproduct. This process is called fermentation.\n\nAfter the fermentation is complete, the beer is ready to be bottled or kegged. Different types of beers are made using different combinations of these ingredients, as well as different brewing processes.\n\nAles and lagers are the two main categories of beer. Ales are made with top-fermenting yeasts, which means the yeast rises to the top of the mixture as it ferments. Ales tend to have a fruitier and more complex flavor. Lagers are made with bottom-fermenting yeasts, which means the yeast settles to the bottom of the mixture as it ferments. Lagers tend to have a cleaner, crisper flavor.\n\nThere are many different types of ales and lagers, such as pale ales, stouts, pilsners, and many more. Each type has its own unique flavor and characteristics, and people often enjoy trying different types to find their favorite."],"9002":["The hair on our head and the hair on the rest of our body are actually different types of hair. The hair on our head is called terminal hair, and it is thicker and longer than the hair on the rest of our body. Terminal hair is also more sensitive to hormones, which is why it continues to grow throughout our lives. The hair on the rest of our body, including arm hair, is called vellus hair. Vellus hair is shorter and finer than terminal hair, and it is not sensitive to hormones in the same way that terminal hair is. This is why the hair on the rest of our body tends to stop growing at a certain point, while the hair on our head continues to grow.\r\n\r\nAs for why our head hair doesn't stop growing at a point that is efficient for warmth, it's actually because head hair serves a number of different purposes. In addition to providing warmth, head hair also helps to protect the scalp from the sun and other environmental factors, and it can also serve as a social and cultural signifier. So, while the hair on the rest of our body may be primarily focused on providing warmth, the hair on our head has a more diverse set of functions."],"5892":["There are many reasons why different societies may associate sex with shame or view it as a private or taboo topic.

It has gained popularity in recent years, but it has also received criticism from some people in the fitness industry and the medical community.\r\n\r\nOne reason Crossfit is sometimes badmouthed is because it can be physically demanding and potentially unsafe if not properly supervised or if participants push themselves too hard. It is important for anyone participating in Crossfit to follow proper form and technique to reduce the risk of injury. It is also important for individuals to listen to their bodies and not try to do more than they are physically capable of, as this can lead to overexertion and injury.\r\n\r\nAnother reason Crossfit has received criticism is because it is not always tailored to the individual needs and goals of each participant. Every person is different and has different fitness levels, abilities, and goals, and a one-size-fits-all approach may not be appropriate for everyone. It is important for any fitness program to be tailored to the individual needs of the participant to be most effective and safe.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that not everyone enjoys or is interested in the high-intensity, competitive nature of Crossfit. Some people prefer more low-impact or individualized fitness activities, and that's completely okay. It's important for each person to find a form of physical activity that they enjoy and that is appropriate for their fitness level and goals.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Crossfit can be a great workout for some people, but it is not right for everyone. It is important for participants to follow proper form and technique, listen to their bodies, and make sure the program is tailored to their individual needs in order to reduce the risk of injury and maximize the benefits of the workout."],"4871":["Drivers are special pieces of software that help your computer communicate with specific hardware devices, like printers, keyboards, and mice.

Another reason is that China has a large supply of raw materials and a large pool of skilled workers, which makes it easier and more cost-effective for companies to manufacture products there. Additionally, China has a large and growing market for consumer goods, so it makes sense for companies to produce products in the country where they will be sold. Finally, China has a strong infrastructure, including roads, ports, and airports, which makes it easier to transport goods both within the country and to other countries around the world."],"9113":["The lifespans of animals are determined by a number of factors, including their size, metabolism, and environment. Dogs and cats are smaller than humans, and their bodies work differently than ours. This means that they age faster and their cells don't last as long. In general, larger animals tend to live longer than smaller animals because their cells don't work as hard and don't wear out as quickly.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that dogs and cats have shorter lifespans than humans is because they are more likely to be exposed to hazards such as disease, accidents, and predators. Dogs and cats also have different lifestyles than humans, which can affect their lifespans. For example, outdoor cats may be more prone to accidents and injuries than indoor cats.\r\n\r\nFinally, genetics plays a role in the lifespan of an animal. Some breeds of dogs and cats are known to live longer than others, just as some human families tend to have members who live longer than others.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, dogs and cats have shorter lifespans than humans because of their size, metabolism, environment, and genetics."],"4971":["Sure!

This creates the illusion that the investment is profitable, when in reality, no actual profits are being made. Bernie Madoff was a famous person who ran a Ponzi scheme. He told people that he was investing their money in the stock market, but he was actually just using the money from new investors to pay the returns promised to earlier investors. When he was finally caught, it was revealed that he had been running this fraudulent scheme for many years, and he had stolen billions of dollars from people all over the world. It's important to be careful when considering any investment opportunity, and to do your own research to make sure that it is legitimate.

For example, the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3 has no solutions in whole numbers. Fermat's Last Theorem is called a theorem because it has been proven to be true. It was first proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in the 17th century, but it wasn't until 1994 that a mathematician named Andrew Wiles was able to provide a complete proof of the theorem. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is quite complex and requires a lot of advanced math. However, there is a simple way to understand why the theorem is true: if we try to find whole number solutions to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for any value of n greater than 2, we quickly run into problems. For example, if we try to find whole number solutions to the equation x^3 + y^3 = z^3, we can quickly see that there are no solutions. This is because no matter what values we choose for x, y, and z, the left side of the equation (x^3 + y^3) will always be a multiple of 3 (since 3 is a factor of every whole number), while the right side of the equation (z^3) will never be a multiple of 3. This means that the equation can never be true, no matter what values we choose for x, y, and z. In conclusion, Fermat's Last Theorem states that there are no whole number solutions to the equation x^n + y^n = z^n for any value of n greater than 2. This theorem was famously difficult to prove, but it has now been proven to be true by mathematician Andrew Wiles."],"15607":["A check is a piece of paper that you can use to pay for things instead of using cash or a credit or debit card.

On the other hand, if you try a food that you really enjoy, you may come to prefer it and seek it out more often. These preferences are formed in the brain and are not a result of any physical changes to the tongue."],"16541":["School buses are designed to be very safe, and one of the ways they are made safe is by having special seats that are designed to protect passengers during a crash. These seats are called \"compartmentalized\" seats, and they are padded and have high backs to help keep kids safe. The seats are also arranged in such a way that they face towards the front of the bus, so that kids are not thrown around if the bus stops suddenly or gets into an accident.\n\nBecause of these special seats, school buses do not need seat belts. The seats are designed to keep kids safe without the need for seat belts. However, some newer school buses do have seat belts, and it is important for kids to use them if they are available.\n\nI hope that helps to explain why school buses do not require seat belts.

These characteristics include things like the person's genes, hormones, and reproductive anatomy. Gender refers to the social and cultural roles that society assigns to men, women, and non-binary people based on their sex. These roles can include things like how a person is expected to dress, behave, and interact with others. Transgender refers to people whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, a person who was assigned male at birth but who identifies as a woman is a transgender woman. Transsexual refers to people who have undergone surgery to change their physical sex, such as by getting a penis or vagina. Transvestite is an outdated term that is not used much anymore. It referred to people who liked to wear clothes that are usually worn by people of the opposite sex. I hope that helps! Do you have any other questions about this?"],"8904":["Those \"whisker-like things\" on tires are called treads. Tires have treads because they help the tire grip the road better. When a tire is new, the treads are usually deep and have a lot of ridges and grooves. As the tire is used, the treads start to wear down, and they become shallower. When the treads are worn down too much, the tire is no longer safe to use because it won't be able to grip the road as well. That's why it's important to check the tread on your tires regularly and replace them when they get too worn."],"4577":["Greenland is the largest island in the world by land area. It is located in the North Atlantic Ocean and is a territory of Denmark.\\n\\nAustralia is sometimes referred to as an \"island continent,\" but it is not considered an island in the traditional sense because it is not entirely surrounded by water. Instead, it is a continent that is mostly surrounded by water, with a small section of land connecting it to Asia. Similarly, North America and Eurasia-Africa are both continents that are mostly surrounded by water, but they are not considered islands because they are not entirely surrounded by water.\\n\\nSo, in order to be considered an island, a piece of land must be completely surrounded by water. Greenland meets this requirement, as it is completely surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and other bodies of water."],"4355":["When you are in bright light, it is easier to shut off one eye and have the other eye open because it helps your eyes adjust to the light. Your eyes are like cameras that help you see the world around you. When you are in a dark room, your eyes open wide to let in as much light as possible so you can see clearly. But when you are in bright light, your eyes need to narrow to keep the light from being too overwhelming. When you close one eye, it helps your other eye narrow and adjust to the bright light. This helps you see better and keeps the light from hurting your eyes. Does that make sense?"],"14869":["Hot water actually doesn't make better ice cubes. The key to making good ice cubes is using clean, filtered water and allowing the ice to freeze slowly in the freezer.\n\nWhen you use hot water to make ice cubes, the hot water can cause the ice cube tray to expand, which can cause the ice cubes to come out misshapen. Additionally, hot water will melt some of the ice as it freezes, which can result in cloudy, opaque ice cubes.\n\nOn the other hand, if you use room temperature or cold water and allow the ice cubes to freeze slowly in the freezer, the water will freeze more evenly and the ice cubes will come out clear and solid.\n\nSo, the best way to make good ice cubes is to use cold or room temperature water and be patient while the ice freezes. Don't use hot water, and don't try to rush the freezing process by placing the ice cube tray in the freezer with the water already in it."],"1369":["Stephen Hawking was not overweight because he did not have the ability to move his body and burn calories through physical exercise. He was diagnosed with a motor neuron disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) when he was 21 years old, which gradually paralyzed him over the course of his life. As a result, he was unable to move his muscles and had to rely on a wheelchair and a computer to communicate. \nAlthough he was unable to move his body, Hawking was still able to burn calories through his basic bodily functions, such as breathing and digestion. The amount of calories a person needs each day depends on their age, gender, height, weight, and activity level. Hawking's body likely burned fewer calories than an able-bodied person because he was unable to engage in physical activity, but he would still have burned some calories through his basic bodily functions. \nIt's also important to note that being overweight or underweight is not necessarily a reflection of a person's health or well-being. There are many factors that can affect a person's weight, including their genetics, diet, and lifestyle. Hawking was a brilliant scientist and was able to live a full and meaningful life despite his physical limitations."],"16286":["Carbureted engines, fuel injected engines, and direct injected engines are all types of internal combustion engines, which means they burn fuel to create power.\n\nIn a carbureted engine, fuel and air are mixed together in a carburetor, which is a device located between the engine and the air intake. The carburetor uses a system of tubes, valves, and a mechanical device called a \"butterfly valve\" to control the amount of fuel and air that enters the engine. The carburetor is then adjusted to provide the right mix of fuel and air for the engine to run smoothly.\n\nFuel injected engines, on the other hand, do not have a carburetor. Instead, they have a device called a fuel injector, which sprays fuel directly into the engine's combustion chamber. The fuel injector is controlled by a computer, which can adjust the amount of fuel that is sprayed into the engine based on various factors, such as the speed of the engine, the temperature, and the load on the engine.\n\nDirect injected engines are a type of fuel injected engine that inject fuel directly into the combustion chamber, rather than into the intake manifold (the part of the engine that leads to the combustion chamber). This allows for more precise control over the fuel-to-air ratio and can result in improved fuel efficiency and performance.\n\nCarbureted engines are not used as much anymore because they are less efficient and more difficult to maintain than fuel injected engines. Fuel injected engines are more popular in performance cars because they can provide better fuel efficiency and performance compared to carbureted engines. Direct injected engines are often used in high-performance vehicles because they can provide even better fuel efficiency and performance compared to traditional fuel injected engines."],"13140":["Russia and Ukraine are two countries located in Eastern Europe. For many years, they were part of the same country called the Soviet Union, which was a communist country that was made up of several different republics. After the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, Ukraine and Russia became two separate countries. In recent years, there has been some tension between the two countries because of a disagreement over a region called Crimea. Crimea is a peninsula that is located on the Black Sea and is home to many people who speak Russian as their first language. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, which means that they took control of the region and made it a part of Russia. However, Ukraine and many other countries do not recognize Crimea as part of Russia and consider it to be an occupied territory. This disagreement has caused tension between Russia and Ukraine, and there have been some conflicts between the two countries as a result."],"7616":["The blade of a guillotine is angled so that it can slice through the neck of a person more efficiently.

It can be due to the person's mood, the dosage of the drug, or outside influences such as their environment or the people they are with.\n\nWhen a person takes drugs, the drug can affect their brain and alter their perception, thoughts, and feelings. This can be a pleasant experience for some people, but for others it can be unpleasant or even scary.\n\nA bad trip can be caused by taking too much of a drug, or by taking a drug that is particularly strong or unpredictable in its effects. It can also be caused by a person's personal mental state, such as if they are feeling anxious or depressed.\n\nExternal factors, like being in an unfamiliar or uncomfortable environment, or being with people who are behaving irresponsibly or aggressively, can also contribute to a bad trip.\n\nIt's important to remember that taking drugs is risky and can have serious, even deadly, consequences.

This digital money is created and managed by the central banks of different countries, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States or the Bank of England in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nCentral banks are responsible for controlling the supply of money in an economy and making sure it is stable and reliable. They do this by setting interest rates, regulating the amount of money that banks can lend, and making sure there is enough physical cash in circulation to meet the needs of people and businesses.\r\n\r\nCentral banks are also responsible for preventing companies from just creating free money, because if everyone could create their own money, it would cause chaos and inflation. Inflation is when the value of money goes down because there is too much of it in circulation. This would make it harder for people to buy things, because the things they want to buy would cost more money.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this from happening, central banks have strict rules about how much money can be created and who can create it. They also have tools to control the supply of money, such as setting interest rates or buying and selling government bonds. This helps to keep the value of money stable and makes sure that it is a reliable form of exchange."],"6806":["Sure!

When traders from the Netherlands first arrived in Japan, they probably used gestures and drawings to try to communicate with the Japanese people. As they spent more time in Japan and had more interactions with the Japanese, they may have learned some basic words and phrases in the Japanese language. They could then use these words and phrases to try to communicate more effectively with the Japanese. Over time, as the Dutch and Japanese traders continued to interact with each other, they would have learned more and more words and phrases in each other's languages, and this would have made it easier for them to communicate and understand each other.

This speed is known as the speed of light, and it is the same no matter how fast or slow the source of the light is moving. Think of light as a wave, like the waves you see in the ocean. The waves in the ocean are caused by the wind blowing over the surface of the water. The energy of the wind is transferred to the water, and the waves move across the surface of the ocean. In a similar way, light is a type of energy that travels through space as a wave. Light is made up of tiny particles called photons, and these photons carry energy with them as they move. The energy of light is related to its frequency, which is how many times the light wave vibrates in a certain amount of time. Higher frequency light has more energy, and lower frequency light has less energy. I hope that helps!

It is not something that should be attempted without proper supervision and safety measures in place. The current record for holding your breath underwater is 11 minutes and 54 seconds, set by a man named St\u00e9phane Mifsud in 2019. This is an incredible feat that required a lot of preparation and discipline. Mifsud is a professional freediver, which means he has trained his body to be able to hold his breath for long periods of time and to dive to great depths without the use of scuba gear. To hold your breath for such a long time, Mifsud had to train his body to be very efficient at using oxygen and to tolerate the build-up of carbon dioxide in his blood. He also had to learn how to control his heart rate and regulate his breathing to conserve oxygen. It is important to note that attempting to hold your breath for extended periods of time can be very dangerous and can lead to serious health issues, including blackout, brain damage, and even death. It is not something that should be attempted without proper training and supervision."],"11027":["Social Security is a program that provides financial assistance to people who are retired, disabled, or otherwise unable to work. The money for this program comes from a tax that is taken out of people's paychecks when they are working.\r\n\r\nWelfare is a program that provides financial assistance to people who are in need. This can include help with things like housing, food, and medical expenses. The money for this program comes from the government's general fund, which is made up of money from taxes and other sources.\r\n\r\nThe reason that Social Security can \"run out\" is because it is only funded by the taxes that are taken out of people's paychecks. If there are more people receiving benefits from Social Security than there are people paying into the program, then the program can run out of money. Welfare, on the other hand, is funded by the government's general fund, which has a larger pool of money to draw from and is not reliant on a specific group of people paying into it. This means that Welfare can continue to provide assistance to people in need even if the program runs out of money for a specific year."],"13914":["Older people may have a harder time learning new technology for a variety of reasons. Here are a few possible reasons: 1. They may not be as familiar with technology as younger people. If someone has not had much experience with technology, it can be harder for them to learn new things. 2. They may have physical challenges that make it harder to use technology. For example, they may have difficulty seeing small text or using a mouse or touchpad. 3. They may have cognitive changes that make it harder to learn new things. As we get older, our brains may not work as quickly or easily as they did when we were younger. To help older people learn new technology, it's important to be patient and to break things down into small, simple steps. It can also be helpful to use visuals and demonstrations to show them how to do things.

Here are a few reasons why polygamy might be considered harmful:\r\n\r\nIt can lead to conflict and tension within the family. When a person has multiple spouses, it can be difficult to make sure that everyone is treated equally and that there is enough time and attention to go around. This can lead to resentment and conflict within the family.\r\n\r\nIt can harm women and children. In many polygamous societies, women are treated as second-class citizens and may not have the same rights as men. Children may also be neglected or mistreated in polygamous households.\r\n\r\nIt can create economic problems. When a person has multiple spouses and children, it can be difficult to provide for everyone's needs. This can lead to financial strain and may even contribute to poverty.\r\n\r\nIt can contribute to the spread of diseases.

Similarly, if a person who was assigned female at birth identifies as male and commits a crime, they would generally be sent to a female prison. There are some exceptions to this rule, and some prison systems have special units or facilities for transgender inmates.

When you drive a car with a manual transmission, you'll need to shift gears to match the speed of the car to the conditions you're driving in. For example, if you're driving up a steep hill, you'll need to shift to a lower gear to give the engine more power to climb the hill. Similarly, if you're driving on the highway and want to go faster, you'll need to shift to a higher gear to make the car more efficient. The extra control you get with a manual transmission is the ability to choose the gear that you want to use. With an automatic transmission, the car will choose the gear for you based on how fast you're going and how much power you're using. But with a manual transmission, you get to decide when to shift gears based on what you feel is best for the car and the conditions you're driving in. One thing to keep in mind is that you'll need to use the clutch pedal to shift gears. The clutch pedal is the one on the left (if you're sitting in the driver's seat). You'll need to press it down to disengage the gears and then use the stick shift to choose the gear you want. Then, you'll release the clutch pedal to engage the new gear. I hope that helps!

It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the total number of people in the labor force, which includes both the employed and the unemployed. \nSometimes, the number of people who are unemployed can go up, even if the unemployment rate goes down. This can happen when the number of people in the labor force decreases. For example, if a lot of people stop looking for work because they are discouraged or have given up hope of finding a job, they are no longer counted as part of the labor force. As a result, the number of unemployed people is divided by a smaller number, which can lead to a lower unemployment rate. \nOn the other hand, if the number of people who are employed increases, the unemployment rate can go down, even if the number of people who are unemployed does not change. This can happen when more people start looking for work because they are more confident about finding a job. In this case, the number of unemployed people is divided by a larger number, which can lead to a lower unemployment rate. \nIt is important to look at both the unemployment rate and the total number of people who are unemployed when evaluating the state of the job market. Together, these two measures can give a more complete picture of the employment situation."],"16843":["The value of a country's currency, such as the Chinese yuan, can affect its economy in several ways. One way a country can try to influence the value of its currency is by manipulating its exchange rate.\n\nAn exchange rate is the price at which one currency can be exchanged for another. For example, if the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Chinese yuan is 1:6.5, it means that one US dollar is worth 6.5 Chinese yuan.\n\nA country can manipulate its exchange rate in various ways. One way is through currency intervention, where the government or central bank buys or sells its own currency in the foreign exchange market to try to influence its value.\n\nFor example, if the Chinese government wants to make the yuan weaker, it could sell large amounts of yuan and buy foreign currencies, such as the US dollar, instead. This would increase the supply of yuan and decrease the demand for it, which could cause the value of the yuan to go down.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Chinese government wants to make the yuan stronger, it could do the opposite: buy large amounts of yuan and sell foreign currencies. This would decrease the supply of yuan and increase the demand for it, which could cause the value of the yuan to go up.\n\nManipulating the exchange rate can have both benefits and drawbacks for a country. For example, a weaker currency can make a country's exports cheaper and more competitive in the global market, which can boost the country's economy. However, a weaker currency can also lead to higher inflation and make it more expensive for the country to import goods from other countries.\n\nIt's important to note that currency manipulation is a complex issue and can have many different effects on a country's economy. Some people argue that currency manipulation can give a country an unfair advantage in international trade, while others argue that it can help stabilize a country's economy and protect it from financial shocks."],"12579":["A cold or the flu can cause your throat to hurt because these illnesses can affect the respiratory system, which includes the throat. When you have a cold or the flu, your body's immune system is working to fight off the virus that is causing the illness. As a result, you may experience symptoms such as a runny nose, coughing, and a sore throat. Coughing is a natural reflex that helps to clear mucus and other irritants from your respiratory system. When you have a cold or the flu, you may produce more mucus than usual, which can cause you to cough more frequently. This coughing can cause irritation in your throat, leading to a sore throat. A runny nose is also a common symptom of a cold or the flu. Mucus produced by the lining of the nasal passages helps to moisturize and protect the nasal passages. When you have a cold or the flu, your body may produce more mucus than usual. This excess mucus can run out of your nose and down the back of your throat, causing irritation and a sore throat.

This is because he has had to learn how to produce the sounds and rhythms of English, which are different from those of German. On the other hand, it is easier for people to copy Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent because he speaks English with a very distinctive and recognizable accent. This means that the sounds and rhythms of his English are easier to identify and imitate than those of a native speaker, who speaks with a more subtle and less distinctive accent. Overall, it is generally easier for people to imitate an accent that is different from their own, because it is easier to identify the specific sounds and rhythms that make up that accent. It is often more difficult for people to lose their own accent and adopt a new one, because it requires a lot of practice and effort to learn how to produce the sounds and rhythms of a new language accurately."],"12197":["The universe is cold by default because there is no inherent source of heat or energy throughout the vast expanse of space. The temperature of the universe is actually not a fixed value, but rather it depends on the amount of matter and radiation present in a given region. In general, the universe is getting colder over time, due to the expansion of space itself. As the universe expands, the matter and radiation within it becomes more diffuse, and thus the temperature decreases. The further away you are from any sources of heat or energy, the colder it will be. As for a limit on how cold it can get, there is a theoretical limit known as absolute zero, which is the temperature at which all matter would stop moving and have zero energy. However, it is thought to be impossible to actually reach this temperature because it would require removing all of the energy from a system, and this goes against the laws of thermodynamics."],"11698":["Wind is caused by differences in air pressure. When the air pressure is higher in one place than another, the air will try to move from the area where the pressure is higher to the area where the pressure is lower. This movement of air is what we feel as wind.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the wind depends on how big the difference in air pressure is. The bigger the difference, the stronger the wind will be.\r\n\r\nWind can change direction because the Earth is round and the air is always trying to balance out the air pressure. So if the wind is blowing from one direction and it hits a mountain or a big building, it might get pushed in a different direction."],"15205":["When you scratch a mosquito bite, it feels good because it releases a chemical called serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a chemical that helps you feel happy and relaxed. When you scratch the mosquito bite, you are stimulating nerve endings in your skin, which sends a signal to your brain that feels good. The act of scratching also helps to relieve the itchiness and discomfort that can come with a mosquito bite. So, scratching a mosquito bite feels good because it releases happy chemicals in your brain and helps to relieve the itchiness and discomfort of the bite."],"7120":["Well, the thing is that animals don't really have a choice in the matter! The organ that they use to pee and reproduce is called the urinary tract, and it just so happens that this is the same place where the female reproductive organs are located. So when an animal needs to pee, they use their urinary tract, and when they need to have a baby, they also use their urinary tract. It might seem a little confusing at first, but it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it.The urinary tract and the reproductive organs are located very close to each other in most animals because they both have to do with the waste and fluids in the body. When an animal pees, they are getting rid of waste and excess fluids that their body doesn't need. And when they have a baby, they also need to get rid of the waste and fluids that come with pregnancy and childbirth.So even though it might seem strange that animals pee and reproduce out of the same place, it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it. It's just a way for their bodies to get rid of all the waste and fluids that they don't need, and to make room for new life to grow and be born."],"13251":["Silicone is used in modern computing because it is an excellent material for making computer chips, which are an essential component of computers. There are a few reasons why silicone is a good material for making computer chips: 1. Silicone is a good conductor of electricity: Computer chips need to be able to conduct electricity in order to function properly. Silicone is a good conductor of electricity, which makes it a good material for making computer chips. 2. Silicone is a good insulator: Computer chips also need to be good insulators, meaning that they should not conduct electricity easily. Silicone is a good insulator, which helps to prevent short circuits on the chip. 3. Silicone is durable: Computer chips need to be able to withstand a lot of wear and tear, and silicone is a very durable material. It can withstand high temperatures and is resistant to many chemicals, which makes it a good choice for use in computer chips. 4. Silicone is easy to work with: It is easy to shape silicone into the tiny, complex structures that are needed for computer chips. This makes it a good material for making computer chips, because it can be molded into the precise shapes and sizes that are needed. As for quantum computing, silicone is not necessarily a key component. Quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, to perform calculations, and these qubits can be made using a variety of materials, including silicone. However, researchers are still working on developing more efficient and stable qubits for use in quantum computers, so it is not yet clear which materials will be used most widely in the future."],"7935":["It's important to remember that countries are not necessarily enemies just because they are different or because they have different interests.

The larger the caliber, the bigger the bullet and the wider the barrel of the gun.\n\nFor example, a .40 caliber bullet is smaller in size than a .50 caliber bullet. Therefore, a handgun that uses .40 caliber bullets would have a smaller barrel than a rifle that uses .50 caliber bullets. The smaller barrel of the handgun allows it to be more easily carried and used with one hand, while the larger barrel of the rifle is necessary to accurately shoot a larger and heavier bullet over longer distances.\n\nI hope that helps to clarify the difference between firearm calibers. Let me know if you have any other questions."],"10659":["Game developers had to be very careful about how they used the space on an N64 cartridge. They had to make sure that all of the game's graphics, sounds, and other important data fit within the limited space of the cartridge.\r\n\r\nOne way that game developers were able to fit more data into the cartridge was by using special techniques to compress the data. This made it possible to fit more data into the same amount of space.\r\n\r\nAnother way that game developers were able to fit more data into the cartridge was by using the N64's powerful hardware to its full potential. The N64 was able to do a lot of the work of rendering graphics and sounds, which meant that the game developers didn't have to include as much data on the cartridge.\r\n\r\nOverall, it took a lot of careful planning and clever techniques to fit all of the data for a big game like Zelda or Super Mario 64 onto an N64 cartridge. But with hard work and determination, game developers were able to make it happen!"],"8186":["Diamond mines take various measures to prevent theft of diamonds by their workers. One way they do this is by having strict security protocols in place. For example, workers may be required to pass through metal detectors or have their bags searched before they enter or leave the mine. They may also be required to wear uniforms or badges that identify them as employees.\r\n\r\nAnother way that diamond mines prevent theft is by carefully tracking and accounting for the diamonds that are mined. This might involve using computer systems to keep track of where each diamond is at all times, or using special tags or markings to identify each diamond.\r\n\r\nFinally, diamond mines may also provide their workers with training and education programs to help them understand the importance of not stealing diamonds. This might include teaching them about the consequences of theft, as well as the ethical and legal implications of such actions.\r\n\r\nOverall, the goal of these measures is to make it difficult or impossible for workers to steal diamonds, and to create a culture of honesty and integrity within the mine."],"15035":["Tires with air are used because they provide a number of benefits over solid rubber tires or tires made of other materials.\n\nOne of the main benefits of using tires with air is that they provide a smoother and more comfortable ride. When a tire is inflated with air, it is able to absorb shock and vibrations from the road, which makes the ride more comfortable for the passengers.\n\nAnother benefit of using tires with air is that they have a lower rolling resistance, which means they require less energy to move. This can improve fuel efficiency and reduce the amount of fuel that a vehicle consumes.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, tires with air are also able to adapt to different road conditions. When a tire is inflated with air, it is able to expand and contract based on the weight of the vehicle and the surface of the road. This allows the tire to maintain good contact with the road, which improves traction and handling.\n\nOverall, tires with air are used because they provide a comfortable ride, have a lower rolling resistance, and are able to adapt to different road conditions."],"5378":["\\nDifferent animals have different things that they are afraid of, and some animals might not be afraid of bugs at all. Humans are often afraid of bugs because they can carry diseases or because they are uncomfortable to touch. Some people are also afraid of bugs because they don't like the way they look, or because they are scared of the way they move.\\n\\nBut other animals might not be afraid of bugs at all. For example, some animals, like birds and lizards, eat bugs as a part of their diet. And some animals, like spiders, are actually bugs themselves! So they might not be afraid of other bugs at all.\\n\\nIn general, animals are more likely to be afraid of things that could hurt them, like predators or dangerous objects. Bugs might not be a threat to some animals, so they might not be afraid of them. But humans, who are often bigger and stronger than bugs, might be more likely to be afraid of them because they don't feel like they have as much control over the situation."],"10813":["It is difficult to predict exactly what would happen if all illicit drugs were legalized, as it would depend on how they were regulated and sold, and how people responded to the change. However, here are some possible impacts that could occur:\r\n\r\nGovernments might see a decrease in drug-related crime, as people would no longer need to buy drugs from illegal sources or engage in criminal activity to obtain them. This could also lead to a reduction in incarceration rates, as fewer people would be jailed for drug offenses.\r\n\r\nDrug cartels and other organized crime groups that rely on the sale of illicit drugs for their income might see a decrease in profits, as their products would be sold legally and competition would increase. This could also lead to a reduction in violence and corruption associated with the illegal drug trade.\r\n\r\nSome people might be more likely to use drugs if they are legal, which could lead to an increase in drug use and addiction. This could also lead to an increase in health problems and accidents related to drug use.\r\n\r\nLegalizing drugs could generate new sources of tax revenue for governments, as they could tax the sale of drugs in the same way they do with alcohol and tobacco. This revenue could be used to fund addiction treatment and other harm reduction efforts.\r\n\r\nThere could be societal changes as well, such as an increase in the acceptance of drug use and a shift in attitudes towards drugs.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that these are just some possible impacts, and the actual effects of drug legalization would depend on many factors."],"1543":["Sure!

There are many different things that can cause nightmares, and it's possible that you have some specific things in your life that are causing you to have more nightmares than other people. Here are a few things that might be contributing to your nightmares:\r\n\r\nStress: If you're feeling stressed or anxious, it can make you more likely to have nightmares.\r\n\r\nCertain medications: Some medications can cause nightmares as a side effect.\r\n\r\nSubstance abuse: Using drugs or alcohol can lead to nightmares.\r\n\r\nMedical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as sleep apnea or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can cause nightmares.\r\n\r\nLack of sleep: Not getting enough sleep can make you more likely to have nightmares.\r\n\r\nIt's important to try to get enough sleep and to practice good sleep hygiene, such as going to bed and waking up at the same time every day and avoiding screens before bedtime. If you're still having a lot of nightmares, it might be helpful to talk to a doctor or a therapist about ways to manage them."],"9120":["Sure! I'd be happy to explain this to you.\r\n\r\nThe color of our skin is determined by a pigment called melanin. Melanin is produced by cells in our skin called melanocytes. When our skin is exposed to the sun, these cells produce more melanin to help protect our skin from the harmful effects of the sun's UV rays.\r\n\r\nThe skin on different parts of our body can be affected differently by the sun. Some parts of the body, like the genitals and anus, are covered by clothing most of the time and are not exposed to the sun very often. As a result, the skin in these areas may not produce as much melanin as other parts of the body that are exposed to the sun more frequently. This can cause the skin in these areas to appear lighter in color.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other parts of the body like the face, arms, and legs are exposed to the sun more frequently and may produce more melanin as a result. This can cause the skin in these areas to appear darker.\r\n\r\nSo to answer your question, some parts of the body turn brown because they are exposed to the sun more frequently and produce more melanin to protect the skin. Other parts of the body may not turn brown because they are covered by clothing and are not exposed to the sun as often."],"4471":["OpenGL and DirectX are software libraries that are used to render 3D graphics on a computer.

However, there are some important differences between poison and venom.\\n\\nPoison is a substance that can be ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin and can cause harm or death to an organism. Poison can be found in plants, animals, and even some chemicals. Poison can be ingested by eating or drinking it, or it can be absorbed through the skin.\\n\\nVenom, on the other hand, is a type of poison that is injected into an organism by a bite or a sting. Venom is produced by animals, such as snakes, spiders, and some insects, and is used for self-defense or for hunting prey. Venom is not meant to be ingested or absorbed through the skin like poison is.

The higher the bit depth, the more accurately the signal can be represented, which can result in a higher quality audio recording. \nA bit depth of 16 bits means that there are 16 bits available to represent the amplitude of the audio signal at each point in time. This allows for a total of 65,536 possible amplitude values, which is a relatively fine level of resolution. \nA bit depth of 24 bits means that there are 24 bits available to represent the amplitude of the audio signal at each point in time. This allows for a total of 16,777,216 possible amplitude values, which is a much finer level of resolution than 16 bits. \nIn general, recordings made at a higher bit depth will have a higher quality and more dynamic range (the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of the recording).

This is because the brain is organized in a way that one half is responsible for controlling the opposite side of the body. So if you are right-handed, it's because the left side of your brain is stronger at controlling the right side of your body, and vice versa. Having a dominant hand or side can be helpful because it allows us to do things more efficiently and with more precision. For example, if you are right-handed and you try to use your left hand to write, it might feel awkward and you might make more mistakes. But if you use your right hand, it might feel more natural and you might be able to write more smoothly. It's not completely understood why some people are right-handed and others are left-handed.

The concept of the \"imaginary number\" i is actually a pretty advanced math concept, so it might be a little difficult to explain to someone who is just starting to learn about math. But I'll do my best to give a simple explanation that you can understand. The \"imaginary number\" i is a number that is used to represent the square root of -1. This might sound strange, because when you square a number (like 2 or 3), you always get a positive result (like 4 or 9). But what if you try to take the square root of a negative number, like -1? It turns out that this is not possible with regular numbers, because the square root of a number must always be positive. However, mathematicians came up with a way to represent the square root of -1 using a special number called \"i\". They define \"i\" as the square root of -1, which means that \"i\" squared is equal to -1. So, for example, if you have the equation \"i * i = -1\", this is true because \"i\" is defined as the square root of -1. The imaginary number \"i\" is used in a lot of different math problems, especially in advanced topics like complex numbers and quantum mechanics. It is also used in engineering and other fields where math is important. Even though it might seem strange at first, the concept of \"i\" is actually very useful and helps us solve a lot of problems that we couldn't solve using regular numbers alone."],"12043":["When you twist a cup with ice in it, the water and the ice are both moving together.

Despite these rules, some players may still decide to use drugs because they want to win or because they feel pressure to perform at a high level. This can lead to drug scandals in baseball, where players are caught using drugs and punished."],"6272":["The reason that older CRT monitors used a black background with green text is because the phosphors (the materials that emit light) used in the CRT displays were most efficient at producing green light. As a result, it was easier to produce a bright, easy-to-read image using green text on a black background. White text on a black background would have required the display to produce more light, which would have been more difficult and may have resulted in a dimmer, less readable display."],"897":["Sure! The reason why large files like video games can be stored on a single disc is because they use a type of storage called Blu-ray. Blu-ray discs are able to hold a lot more data than DVDs, which is why they are able to store large files like video games. \nOn the other hand, seasons of shows or movies may be stored on multiple DVDs because they may not fit on a single DVD. This is because DVDs can hold less data than Blu-ray discs. \nThink of it like a bucket. A Blu-ray disc is like a large bucket that can hold a lot of water (data). A DVD is like a smaller bucket that can hold less water. If you have a lot of water (data) to store, you might need to use multiple smaller buckets (DVDs) to hold it all. But if you don't have as much water (data), you might be able to use a single large bucket (Blu-ray disc) to hold it all. Does that make sense?"],"10817":["Advertisers often use television and other forms of media to reach a wide audience, and this can include people who live in areas where their products or services are not physically available. In the case of Sonic, the company may be running advertisements on national television in an effort to increase brand awareness and attract customers who live in areas where Sonic restaurants do exist. Even though there may not be any Sonic restaurants in Alaska, the advertisements may still be shown there as part of the company's broader marketing efforts."],"2832":["Libertarianism is a political philosophy that advocates for individual freedom and limited government. It is based on the idea that people should be able to do as they please as long as they respect the rights of others and do not harm anyone else. One of the main arguments for libertarianism is that individuals are the best judges of their own needs and desires, and that they should be able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives without interference from the government or other authorities. One argument against libertarianism is that it can lead to a society where some people are able to take advantage of others or accumulate wealth and power at the expense of the less fortunate. Some people also argue that a completely free market can result in economic instability and inequality, and that the government needs to regulate certain industries and provide certain services to ensure the common good. Another argument against libertarianism is that it can be difficult to define what counts as \"harm\" or \"rights\" and that there may be situations where the government needs to intervene to protect the rights of individuals or to prevent harm to society as a whole. Overall, libertarianism is a complex and controversial ideology that is open to different interpretations and applications."],"7360":["Movies can be advertised on TV before they are rated because the rating process can take some time. There are different organizations that are responsible for rating movies, and they have specific guidelines and procedures that they follow. It can take several weeks or even months for a movie to go through the rating process, depending on how long it takes for the organization to review the movie and make a decision about the rating. In the meantime, the movie can be advertised on TV and other places to build excitement and interest for its release. Once the movie has been rated, it will be given an official rating, such as G (for General Audience), PG (for Parental Guidance Suggested), PG-13 (for Parents Strongly Cautioned), R (for Restricted), or NC-17 (for No Children Under 17). This rating will tell viewers what age group the movie is suitable for and give them an idea of what kind of content they can expect to see in the movie."],"15756":["It's not really accurate or helpful to think about being gay as something that someone is \"born\" with or \"chooses\" to be. Sexual orientation is a complex aspect of a person's identity that is influenced by a variety of factors, including biology, environment, and personal experience. Some people might use the language of \"being born\" gay or \"choosing\" to be gay as a way to describe their own experience or feelings about their sexual orientation, but it's important to recognize that these are just words and do not fully capture the complexity of human identity.\n\nThere is no one \"correct\" way to describe one's own sexual orientation, and people are free to use whatever language they feel comfortable with.

This can be something you ate that didn't agree with your body, or it could be a virus or bacteria that has caused an infection.\\n\\nAs your intestines work hard to get rid of the problem, they can sometimes contract and squeeze very hard, which can cause cramps in your belly. These cramps can be very painful and can make you feel like you have a stomachache.\\n\\nSometimes when you have diarrhea, your body can also respond by sweating and feeling clammy. This is because your body is working hard to get rid of the problem, and this can cause your body to feel hot and uncomfortable. It's also possible that you might feel like you're about to die because diarrhea can be a very unpleasant experience and can make you feel very sick.\\n\\nIt's important to drink plenty of fluids when you have diarrhea, as it can help to replace the fluids that your body is losing.

The alphabet is a set of letters that are used to represent the sounds of spoken language. These letters are used to write words, and the order of the letters in the alphabet helps us to know which letter comes first and which comes next when we spell a word. For example, if we want to spell the word \"cat,\" we know that the letter \"c\" comes before the letter \"a,\" and the letter \"a\" comes before the letter \"t.\" This helps us to write the word correctly and also helps other people to read it. The alphabet is usually ordered in a specific way, with the letters arranged in the order that they are most commonly used. This makes it easier for people to learn and use the alphabet, and also makes it easier for people to find the letters they need when they are spelling or reading words. So, while the alphabet doesn't have to be ordered in a specific way, it is useful for it to be organized in a way that makes it easy for people to use."],"9560":["Ejaculation is the release of semen from the male reproductive system. It usually occurs as a result of sexual arousal and can be accompanied by an orgasm, which is a feeling of intense pleasure. After a man ejaculates, he may experience a decrease in sexual desire, or libido, and may not be as interested in sexual activity for a period of time. This is a natural process that occurs as the body's hormone levels return to their normal levels.\r\n\r\nAs for why some women may seem less attractive after certain events or activities, this is a subjective perception that can be influenced by many factors, including a person's personal preferences, cultural values, and emotional state.

A transistor is a tiny electronic device that is used to amplify or switch electronic signals. It's made up of three layers of a special type of material, called semiconductor material, stacked on top of each other. The layers are separated by very thin layers of insulation, which helps keep the layers separate and allows electricity to flow through them in a controlled way.\\n\\nIntegrated circuits, also called chips, are made up of many transistors that are connected together to perform a specific task, like running a computer or a phone. The more transistors that are on a chip, the more complex tasks it can perform.\\n\\nThere are a few reasons why we can't make a chip with 86 billion transistors. First, it would be extremely difficult to manufacture a chip with that many transistors because the transistors are so small and need to be placed very accurately on the chip. Second, even if we could make a chip with that many transistors, it would be very expensive and require a lot of energy to run. Finally, it's not clear that we actually need a chip with that many transistors to perform most tasks. While more transistors can allow a chip to perform more complex tasks, there is a point of diminishing returns where adding more transistors doesn't provide much additional benefit."],"8016":["There are a few reasons why major national decisions are not made by a \"yes\/no\" vote by the people in most countries.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that it can be difficult to get a large number of people to agree on a single issue. There are often many different opinions and perspectives on a given issue, and it can be difficult to find a solution that satisfies everyone.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that it can be difficult to determine exactly what the question is asking. For example, if the question is about a complex policy issue, such as healthcare reform, it may be difficult for people to fully understand the implications of their vote without more information.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are often other factors at play in major national decisions, such as the costs and benefits of different options, the feasibility of implementing a particular solution, and the potential long-term consequences. These factors can be difficult to communicate to the general public in a way that is easy to understand.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are often legal and procedural considerations that must be taken into account when making major national decisions. For example, in many countries, there are specific laws and procedures that must be followed when making changes to government policies or legislation. These processes can be complex and may involve multiple steps, such as committee hearings, debates, and votes by elected representatives."],"7127":["Rockets do go very fast when they are launching into space, but it can look slow from a distance because the rocket is so far away and it takes a long time for it to travel through the air.

They are designed to be easy to use and maintain, even in difficult conditions.\r\n\r\nOne way the Kalashnikov weapons are made simpler is by using a straightforward gas-operated mechanism to fire the weapon. This means that when the gun is fired, some of the hot gases from the burning gunpowder are used to push a piston, which then moves a bolt back and forth to load and fire the next round. This is simpler than other types of mechanisms, which can be more complex and require more parts.\r\n\r\nThe Kalashnikov weapons are also made to be hardier than other weapons by using durable materials and being designed to withstand harsh environments. For example, the AK-47 is made mostly of steel and wood, which are both strong materials that can withstand a lot of wear and tear. The weapon is also coated with a rust-resistant finish to help it withstand exposure to the elements.\r\n\r\nThese features make the Kalashnikov weapons popular with military and law enforcement organizations around the world, as well as with civilians who need a reliable and easy-to-use firearm. They are especially popular in countries with harsh climates or limited resources, as they can be counted on to work even in difficult conditions."],"7258":["IVs, or intravenous lines, are tubes that are inserted into a person's vein and are used to give fluids, such as water, electrolytes, and medicine, directly into the bloodstream. There are many reasons why someone in a hospital might need an IV, including:To stay hydrated: If a person is not able to drink enough fluids due to illness, surgery, or other reasons, an IV can help them get the fluids they need to stay hydrated.To give medicine: Some medications need to be given through an IV because they work better when they are delivered directly into the bloodstream.To replace fluids: If a person has lost a lot of fluids due to vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, or other reasons, an IV can help replace those fluids and prevent dehydration.To treat low blood pressure: If a person's blood pressure is too low, an IV can help raise it by giving fluids and electrolytes.Overall, IVs are a safe and effective way to give fluids and medicine to people who need them, and they can be used in a variety of different medical situations."],"2829":["Sure!

This is done by finding ways to represent the data using fewer bits of information. For example, if a file has a lot of repetitive data or patterns, the zip algorithm can use fewer bits to represent that data. However, zip files are not always able to compress the data as much as they could in theory. This is because the data might not have enough repeating patterns or it might already be compressed in a way that the zip algorithm cannot make any further improvements. So when you unzip a file, it expands back to its original size, or sometimes even larger. This is why the unzipped version of a file can be bigger than the zip file itself. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"3371":["Great question! The reason why many objects in space, like planets and stars, are shaped like spheres is because of gravity. Gravity is a force that pulls everything towards the center of an object. When an object has a lot of mass, like a planet or a star, the force of gravity is strong enough to shape the object into a sphere. Imagine you have a ball made of clay. If you put the ball on a flat surface, it will stay in the same shape. But if you put the ball in a place where there is a lot of gravity, like the surface of a planet, the ball will be pulled down towards the center of the planet. As the ball gets closer to the center, the force of gravity will become stronger and stronger, and the ball will start to flatten out into a sphere. This happens to planets and stars because they are made of gas, dust, and other materials that can be shaped by the force of gravity. So even though it might seem like other shapes, like cubes or cones, would be possible, the force of gravity is usually strong enough to make these objects take on a spherical shape."],"4814":["Inflation is when the prices of goods and services go up over time. It can happen for a variety of reasons, but one of the main reasons is when a country is printing too much money. When a country has a lot of money in circulation, but not enough goods and services to match, it can lead to higher prices because people are willing to pay more for the same goods and services. This is especially true if the country is in economic trouble and people are worried that their money won't be worth as much in the future. In the case of Venezuela, their inflation rate is so high because the government has been printing a lot of money to try to fix their economic problems, but it has only made things worse."],"4549":["Movies and TV shows are typically shot with a higher frame rate than 24 fps.

This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as economic downturns, political instability, or poor financial management. If a country defaults on its debt, it can have serious consequences. For one thing, it can lead to a loss of confidence in the country's ability to manage its finances, which can make it more difficult for the country to borrow money in the future. This can have a negative impact on the country's economy, as it may be unable to fund important projects or initiatives. In addition, if a country defaults on its debt, it may face legal action from its creditors, who may try to recover their money through the courts. This can be a long and expensive process, and it can further damage the country's reputation and creditworthiness.

The cockpit of an airplane is not completely separate from the passenger area for a few reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, the cockpit needs to be accessible to the rest of the plane in case of emergencies. For example, if there is a fire in the cockpit, the pilots need to be able to quickly and easily exit the cockpit and alert the passengers and crew.\r\n\r\nSecond, the cockpit also needs to be accessible for maintenance and repair. Sometimes, equipment in the cockpit needs to be fixed or replaced, and this can only be done by technicians who need to be able to enter the cockpit.\r\n\r\nFinally, making the cockpit completely separate from the rest of the plane would be very expensive and heavy, which would make the plane less fuel efficient.

The protesters believed that the financial sector, particularly Wall Street, played a large role in the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, which resulted in widespread economic hardship and unemployment. They also believed that the financial sector continued to wield a disproportionate amount of influence and power in the aftermath of the crisis. The protesters wanted to bring attention to these issues and to call for greater economic and social justice. They also demanded that the government take steps to address income inequality and to hold the financial sector accountable for its actions.

Imagine you have a big ball (the sun) and a smaller ball (a planet) and you want to throw the smaller ball around the big ball. If you throw the smaller ball in a straight line, it will just fly off into space. But if you throw it at an angle, it will curve around the big ball and continue to orbit. Now, imagine you throw the smaller ball even harder. It will go faster and follow a more curved path. And if you throw it even harder, it will go even faster and follow an even more curved path. The path that the smaller ball follows as it orbits the big ball is called an ellipse. An ellipse is like a stretched out circle, with one side being longer than the other. The big ball is located at a point called the focus of the ellipse. So, planets orbit the sun in ellipses because they are thrown at an angle and are affected by the sun's gravity, which makes them follow a curved path. This is why planets don't just fly off into space, but instead stay in orbit around the sun.

There is also concern that the use of GM crops could lead to the development of herbicide-resistant weeds, which could be difficult to control.\n\nDespite these concerns, many scientists and organizations, including the World Health Organization, believe that GM foods have the potential to offer significant benefits, including increased crop yields, improved resistance to pests and diseases, and increased food security in developing countries."],"4810":["Nintendo Labo is a series of DIY (do-it-yourself) cardboard kits that you can use to build interactive toys, called \"Toy-Con,\" with your Nintendo Switch video game console. Each Labo kit comes with pre-cut cardboard sheets, along with other materials like string, rubber bands, and stickers, that you use to build the Toy-Con.\\n\\nOnce you've built the Toy-Con, you can use it with the Nintendo Switch to play games and do other activities. For example, one Toy-Con is a fishing rod that you can use to play a fishing game on the Switch. Another Toy-Con is a piano that you can use to play music on the Switch.\\n\\nSo, in short, Nintendo Labo is a combination of building and playing with interactive toys that use the Nintendo Switch as the \"brain\" to make them work. It's a fun way to learn about how different technologies work and to use your creativity to build and play with your own toys."],"3763":["The United Nations Security Council is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. It has 15 member states, 5 of which are permanent members with veto power and 10 of which are elected for two-year terms. The permanent members are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and these countries were given veto power as part of the agreement that established the United Nations after World War II. France was one of the original members of the United Nations and was included as a permanent member of the Security Council because it was one of the major Allied powers in World War II. At the time, these countries were seen as the most influential and important in the world, and they were given special privileges in the U.N. as a way to ensure that they would cooperate in maintaining international peace and security. Other countries, like Brazil, India, and Japan, are not currently permanent members of the Security Council, but they can still play important roles in the U.N. and contribute to international peace and security in other ways. They can serve on the Security Council as elected members, participate in U.N. peacekeeping missions, and work with other countries to address global challenges."],"15915":["The subprime crisis, also known as the financial crisis, was a period of economic turmoil that began in the late 2000s and had significant impacts on the United States and Europe.\n\nBasically, what happened was that banks and other financial institutions started lending money to people who were not very likely to be able to pay it back. These loans were called \"subprime mortgages\" because the borrowers were considered to be a higher risk than prime borrowers. The banks then bundled these subprime mortgages together and sold them to other investors as securities.\n\nAs a result, more and more people were taking on more and more debt, and the value of the securities that were based on these subprime mortgages started to go up. This created a bubble in the housing market, where the prices of homes were going up and up.\n\nHowever, eventually, the bubble burst, and the value of the securities plummeted. This caused a chain reaction, as many banks and other financial institutions had invested heavily in these securities, and now they were worth much less than they had been. This led to a financial crisis, as many banks and other financial institutions were in danger of going bankrupt.\n\nThe consequences of the financial crisis were severe. In the United States, many people lost their homes, and the unemployment rate soared. In Europe, the crisis also had a significant impact, as many banks and other financial institutions were in danger of going bankrupt. The crisis led to a recession, which is when the economy slows down and people lose their jobs.\n\nOverall, the financial crisis was caused by too much debt and risky lending practices, and it had serious consequences for both the United States and Europe."],"4142":["When you're in an airplane, you don't feel like you're tipping sideways because you and everything else inside the airplane are moving together as a unit. The plane is designed to stay level and balanced even when it's tilting or turning.\\n\\nImagine that you're sitting in a chair on a big, flat surface. If you tilt the surface you're sitting on, you'll feel like you're tilting with it because you and the chair are moving together. But if you tilt your chair while you're sitting on a flat surface, you'll feel like you're tilting because the chair is moving, but the surface you're sitting on is staying still.\\n\\nIt's the same thing with an airplane. When the plane tilts or turns, everything inside the plane moves together, so you don't feel like you're tilting or moving around. But when you're in a car, the car is moving and turning, but you and everything else inside the car are staying relatively still, so you feel like you're moving back and forth.\\n"],"4162":["Water has a property called surface tension, which means that the molecules of water tend to stick together and form a surface that is strong and resists being broken. When you put a piece of tissue in contact with a droplet of water, the water droplet is attracted to the fibers of the tissue because of capillary action. Capillary action is the movement of a liquid through a small opening or channel, such as the tiny spaces between the fibers in a piece of tissue.\\n\\nThe water molecules are attracted to the fibers in the tissue and they start to climb up the tissue because of capillary action. As the water moves up the tissue, the surface tension of the water helps to pull more water molecules up with it. This is why the water droplet appears to \"climb\" up into the tissue.\\n\\nIt's important to note that this process is driven by the forces of attraction between the water molecules and the fibers in the tissue, and it is not caused by the water being \"sucked\" up into the tissue. The water droplet will continue to climb up the tissue until it reaches a point where the forces of gravity and surface tension are balanced, at which point the droplet will stop moving and stay in place."],"13314":["It's completely normal to find humor in situations that involve other people getting hurt, as long as the harm is not serious and the person is not actually in danger. Many people find humor in situations where someone is trying to do something, but then something unexpected happens and they end up falling or getting hurt in a comical way. This is often called \"slapstick\" humor. One reason people find this type of humor funny is because it is a way to release tension or stress. Laughing can be a way to cope with difficult or uncomfortable situations, and it can help people feel more relaxed and happy. Another reason people find this type of humor funny is because it allows them to experience a sense of superiority. When we see someone else making a mistake or getting hurt, it can make us feel better about ourselves and our own abilities. It's important to remember that it's not okay to laugh at someone who is genuinely hurt or in danger. It's also important to be mindful of other people's feelings and to make sure that they are okay with being the subject of humor."],"7921":["Sexual dimorphism is the term used to describe the physical differences between males and females in a species. In some species, the males are larger than the females, and in other species, the females are larger than the males. There are a few different reasons why this might happen.One reason is that it can help the species to survive and reproduce. For example, in some species of birds, the males have brightly colored feathers to attract females. In other species, the females are the ones with colorful feathers. This can help the females to choose the best mate for their babies.Another reason is that it can help the males and females to do different jobs. For example, in some species of ants, the males have wings so they can fly and find new places to live. The females don't have wings because they stay in the nest and take care of the babies.So, the size difference between males and females in a species can depend on many different things, including what they need to do to survive and have babies."],"8519":["There are a few reasons why college tuition costs continue to increase at such a fast pace.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that it costs a lot of money for colleges and universities to run their programs and provide services to students. This includes things like hiring professors and staff, maintaining buildings and grounds, and providing resources like libraries and labs. As the cost of these things goes up, colleges and universities may need to charge more for tuition to cover their expenses.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that there is often a lot of competition among colleges and universities to attract the best students. Some schools may try to attract students by offering more resources or better facilities, which can also be expensive. This can lead to a \"arms race\" of sorts, where schools are trying to outdo each other and may end up charging higher tuition in order to fund these improvements.\r\n\r\nFinally, college tuition may also be influenced by government policies and funding. In some cases, state governments may not provide as much funding to public colleges and universities as they used to, which can lead to higher tuition costs for students.\r\n\r\nOverall, there are many factors that contribute to the increasing cost of college tuition, and it can be a complex issue."],"9390":["Yes, dreaming and imagination both involve the use of the brain. When you dream, your brain is still active and is processing and organizing information, even though you are asleep. Similarly, when you imagine something, your brain is also active and is creating a mental image or scenario in your mind. Both of these processes involve the use of various parts of the brain, including the frontal lobe, which is responsible for things like planning and decision-making, and the temporal lobe, which is involved in processing and organizing sensory information. So, in a sense, dreaming and imagination are similar in that they both involve the use of the brain to create and process information, but they differ in that dreaming occurs during sleep and imagination occurs when you are awake."],"15707":["Yes, sending letters via birds was a real thing. It was called \"pigeon post\" or \"pigeon mail.\" Pigeons are a type of bird that have been trained to carry messages for a long time. People used them to send important messages because they are fast and can fly long distances.\n\nTo control the destination of the pigeon, people used special bands or rings on the pigeon's leg to identify it. They also trained the pigeon to fly back to a certain place, like their home or a special pigeon house called a \"pigeon loft.\" This way, when the pigeon returned with a message, the person who sent it would know where to find it.\n\nPeople also used other birds, like doves or seagulls, to carry messages. However, pigeons were the most commonly used because they are strong and reliable flyers."],"4984":["Intermittent fasting is a pattern of eating that involves regular periods of not eating, or fasting, interspersed with periods of eating. There are several different methods of intermittent fasting, but one common method is to fast for 16 hours and then eat during an 8-hour window each day.\\n\\nThe idea behind intermittent fasting is that it can help with weight loss and improve certain health markers, such as blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Some people believe that intermittent fasting works because it can help to increase insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and improve overall metabolism.\\n\\nIntermittent fasting may be safe for most healthy adults, but it is not suitable for everyone. It is important to talk to a healthcare provider before starting any new eating pattern, especially if you have a medical condition or are taking medications.\\n\\nTo do intermittent fasting, you can start by choosing a window of time during the day when you will eat, and then not eat outside of that window. For example, you might decide to eat between 12pm and 8pm and then not eat anything else until 12pm the next day. It is important to make sure that you are still getting all of the nutrients your body needs, even though you are eating less frequently. You can do this by eating a healthy, balanced diet during your eating window."],"14595":["Analogue TV tuners and analogue radio tuners both work by receiving and interpreting electromagnetic waves, which are a type of energy that travels through the air. These waves can carry different types of information, such as audio (for radio) or video and audio (for TV). Analogue TV tuners and analogue radio tuners both have a mechanism for selecting which frequency, or channel, to tune in to. In the case of an analogue TV tuner, this is typically done by physically clicking a button or turning a dial to select the desired channel. This changes the tuning of the tuner, allowing it to receive and interpret the electromagnetic waves being transmitted at that specific frequency. Analogue radio tuners, on the other hand, typically have a sliding scale or dial that allows the user to select the desired frequency. As the dial is moved, it changes the tuning of the tuner to receive and interpret the electromagnetic waves being transmitted at that specific frequency. So, the reason why analogue TV tuners click from channel to channel while analogue radio tuners slide along a scale is because they have different mechanisms for selecting the desired frequency. Analogue TV tuners typically use a button or dial, while analogue radio tuners use a sliding scale or dial."],"344":["When plastic is bent or stretched, it is subjected to mechanical stress. This can cause the molecules in the plastic to become rearranged, causing the plastic to appear white or cloudy. \nPlastic is made up of long chains of molecules called polymers. These molecules are held together by chemical bonds, which give the plastic its strength and rigidity. When the plastic is subjected to mechanical stress, such as when it is bent or stretched, the bonds between the molecules can become strained or broken. As a result, the molecules become rearranged and the plastic may appear white or cloudy. \nThis phenomenon is known as \"stress whitening,\" and it is a common occurrence in many types of plastic. It is usually temporary, and the plastic will return to its original color once the stress is relieved. However, if the plastic is subjected to too much stress, it can become permanently damaged, causing it to break or become deformed."],"16817":["Sure! Here is the solution to the \"100 monks riddle\" explained in a way that a five-year-old might understand:\n\nThere are 100 monks on an island. They all follow a set of rules that they must always follow. One of the rules is that they must always tell the truth, and another rule is that they must never lie.\n\nOne day, the monks had a problem. They needed to get a heavy stone across a bridge, but the bridge was too weak to support the weight of the stone. They had to figure out a way to get the stone across the bridge without breaking it.\n\nThe monks came up with a plan. They would all stand on the bridge and pass the stone from one monk to the next until it reached the other side. But there was a catch - only the monk who was holding the stone was allowed to speak.\n\nThe monks started passing the stone from one to the next, and as they did, they all followed the rules and only spoke the truth. But as they got closer to the other side, one of the monks realized that there was a way to trick the others.\n\nThe monk holding the stone knew that the other monks would always follow the rules and only speak the truth. So, he decided to ask a question that would allow him to figure out who was next in line to receive the stone.\n\nHe asked, \"Will the next monk who receives the stone be wearing a red robe?\" The monk who was next in line knew that he was wearing a red robe, so he had to answer \"yes.\" But this answer broke the rule that the monks must always tell the truth.\n\nThe monks were confused by this answer, and they had to figure out what was going on. They realized that the monk holding the stone had tricked them by asking a question that broke the rule of always telling the truth.\n\nIn the end, the monks were able to solve the problem and get the stone across the bridge without breaking it. And they learned an important lesson about always following the rules and being careful with the questions they ask."],"6042":["In a computer's CPU, a \"core\" is a physical unit that performs tasks, and a \"thread\" is a virtual unit that the CPU uses to perform tasks. Each core can have multiple threads, and each thread can be assigned a specific task to work on.\\n\\nImagine that you are a chef in a kitchen and you have to make a big batch of cookies. You can only make one cookie at a time, so if you have a lot of orders to fill, it will take you a long time to finish. But what if you had an assistant chef who could help you make the cookies? Together, you could make the cookies faster because each of you can work on a different cookie at the same time. The cores in a CPU are like the chefs, and the threads are like the assistant chefs. The more cores and threads a CPU has, the more tasks it can work on at the same time and the faster it can finish those tasks."],"8015":["Banks make money by borrowing money from some customers, such as individuals or businesses, and lending it to other customers at a higher rate of interest. The difference between the rate at which the bank borrows money and the rate at which it lends money is called the \"spread,\" and it is the main source of the bank's profit.\r\n\r\nTo adjust for inflation, banks can increase the interest rates they charge on loans. Inflation is when the general price level of goods and services increases over time, which means that the same amount of money is worth less in the future. By charging higher interest rates, banks can compensate for the fact that the money they lend will be worth less in the future due to inflation.\r\n\r\nBanks can also compensate for inflation by investing in assets that are expected to increase in value over time, such as stocks or real estate.\r\n\r\nTo reimburse their customers fully without collapsing, banks need to make sure that they have enough money on hand to cover all of the money that their customers want to withdraw. They do this by setting aside a certain amount of money as reserves, which they can use to pay customers if necessary. In addition, banks are regulated by government agencies, which require them to maintain a certain level of financial stability and to hold a certain amount of capital as a buffer against losses.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to explain how banks make money, adjust for inflation, and remain financially stable.

The U.S. also has military bases in other countries, which are considered \"foreign\" bases because they are located outside the United States and are often operated in cooperation with the host country. Japan and South Korea are two countries that host U.S. military bases within their borders. These bases are there to help protect the United States and its allies, and to support military operations around the world. In exchange for hosting these bases, the U.S. provides support and assistance to Japan and South Korea, including helping to defend them against potential threats. Overall, the presence of foreign military bases can be a complex issue, and each country has to decide for itself whether it is in its best interests to host foreign military bases."],"569":["A cone, or plume, forms when a space shuttle engine starts up because of the way that the fuel is burned. When the fuel is ignited, it creates hot gases that expand rapidly and escape through the nozzle at the back of the engine. As the gases escape, they push against the surrounding air, creating a cone-shaped plume. \nThe shape of the plume is determined by a number of factors, including the shape of the nozzle, the temperature and pressure of the gases, and the properties of the surrounding air. The plume can also be influenced by the shape and size of the vehicle, as well as the position of the engine. \nOverall, the plume forms because of the basic laws of physics that govern how gases behave when they are heated and pressurized. It is an important part of the space shuttle's propulsion system, as it helps to provide the thrust that is needed to lift the vehicle off the ground and into space."],"3390":["A \"circlejerk\" is a term used to describe a situation in which a group of people are just agreeing with each other and not really critically evaluating the ideas being discussed. It can also refer to a situation where people are just repeating the same thing over and over again without really adding anything new to the conversation. Essentially, a \"circlejerk\" is when a group of people are not having a meaningful or productive discussion, but are instead just reinforcing each other's beliefs or opinions. It's often used as a criticism of groupthink or echo chambers, where people only surround themselves with others who agree with them, and don't expose themselves to new or different ideas."],"1555":["The speed of light is a special speed that is the maximum speed at which information or matter can travel. When two objects are moving towards each other at 3\/4 the speed of light, they will still appear to be moving at 3\/4 the speed of light relative to an observer who is stationary. However, to each other, they will appear to be moving faster than the speed of light because they are approaching each other at a speed that is greater than the speed of light. \nThis does not go against the theory that no mass can reach a velocity faster than the speed of light, because the objects are not actually moving faster than the speed of light. Instead, it is just an illusion created by the relative motion of the objects. \nIt's a bit like if you are standing on a moving train and throw a ball towards the back of the train. From your perspective, the ball is moving towards the back of the train at a certain speed. But from the perspective of someone standing on the ground, the ball is moving at a different speed because it is also moving in the same direction as the train. The ball is not actually moving faster than it would if the train was not moving, it just appears to be moving faster because of the motion of the train."],"6938":["In some countries, like Japan, it is common to eat raw fish and other raw meats. However, in other countries, it is not as common and is sometimes even considered unsafe to eat raw meat. This is because raw meat can contain harmful bacteria that can cause food poisoning if it is not cooked properly. Cooking meat helps to kill off any bacteria that might be present, which makes it safer to eat. So, in countries where it is not common to eat raw meat, it is generally recommended to cook it thoroughly to reduce the risk of getting sick."],"9869":["Rear wheel drive (RWD) cars are generally considered better for racing than front wheel drive (FWD) cars because they can put power down more effectively.\r\n\r\nIn a FWD car, the engine's power is delivered to the front wheels, which also have to steer the car. This can cause a phenomenon called \"torque steer,\" where the car tries to pull in one direction or the other under acceleration. This can make the car difficult to control, especially at high speeds.\r\n\r\nIn a RWD car, the engine's power is delivered to the rear wheels. This allows the front wheels to focus on steering the car, making it easier to control and allowing the driver to get the most out of the engine's power.\r\n\r\nThere are other factors that can make RWD cars better for racing as well, such as a more balanced weight distribution and the ability to fine-tune the car's handling with the use of different tire sizes and suspension settings. However, torque steer is a major reason why RWD cars are often preferred for racing."],"3954":["Guitarists might prefer guitars and amps from the 1950s-1970s because they like the way they sound.

During this time, the stock market, which is a place where people can buy and sell shares of ownership in companies, fell dramatically in value. This caused many people to lose a lot of money, as the value of their investments plummeted. The federal reserve is a system of banks and other financial institutions that work together to help manage the country's money supply and stabilize the economy. One of the main reasons the federal reserve was put in place was to help prevent financial crises like the stock market crash of the 1930s from happening again. The federal reserve can use various tools, such as setting interest rates and regulating the amount of money in circulation, to try to keep the economy stable and prevent financial crises. So, in simple terms, the federal reserve was created to help prevent big financial problems like the stock market crash of the 1930s from happening again."],"3669":["If someone goes to jail for something that later becomes legal, they may be able to appeal their conviction and potentially get released from jail. This is because the law that they were convicted under is no longer in effect and it would not be fair to continue to punish them for something that is no longer a crime. However, the process of appealing a conviction and getting released from jail can be complicated and may require the help of a lawyer. It is also important to note that each case is different and the specific circumstances surrounding a person's conviction and imprisonment will be taken into account when determining whether or not they should be released. So to answer your question, if someone in Nevada went to jail for weed before it became legal, they may be able to appeal their conviction and potentially be released from jail once weed becomes legal in Nevada. However, this would depend on the specific details of their case and whether or not they are able to successfully appeal their conviction."],"4564":["Our ears ring or make a high pitched sound because of something called tinnitus.

Some people believe that the Church has a history of mistreating its members and covering up abuse.\r\n\r\nBelief that Scientology is not a legitimate religion: Some people believe that Scientology is not a genuine religion, but rather a profit-seeking organization that uses religious language and practices to manipulate and exploit its members.\r\n\r\nControversial beliefs and practices: Some people find the beliefs and practices of Scientology to be strange or bizarre, and may view the Church with suspicion or disdain as a result.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that not everyone who is critical of Scientology has the same specific reasons for their criticism, and that the Church of Scientology and its members may have a different perspective on these issues."],"9955":["The decision to award the Olympic Games to a particular city or country is made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which is a group of people responsible for organizing the Olympic Games and overseeing the Olympic movement. The IOC is made up of representatives from different countries around the world, and they use a variety of criteria to evaluate potential host cities and countries.\r\n\r\nOne of the main criteria the IOC uses is the ability of the host city or country to provide the necessary infrastructure and facilities to hold the Olympic Games. This includes things like sports venues, accommodation for athletes and visitors, and transportation systems. The IOC also considers factors such as the environmental impact of the Games, the potential for economic development and tourism, and the cultural and social aspects of the host city or country.\r\n\r\nSometimes, countries that have had a history of oppression or human rights abuses may be selected to host the Olympic Games. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a desire to use the Olympic Games as a way to promote positive change and reform in the host country, or a belief that hosting the Games will bring economic benefits and international recognition to the country. However, it's important to note that the IOC has strict rules and guidelines in place to ensure that the Olympic Games are held in a way that is fair, safe, and respectful of human rights."],"14635":["Homosexuality exists because it is a natural part of human diversity. Just like some people have brown eyes and some people have blue eyes, some people are attracted to people of the same gender and some people are attracted to people of a different gender.\n\nEven though people who are attracted to the same gender might not have children with each other in the same way that straight couples do, they can still contribute to the survival of the human race in many other ways. For example, they can help raise children, take care of sick or elderly family members, and contribute to their communities in many other ways.\n\nIt's also important to remember that not all aspects of human behavior and biology are directly related to survival and reproduction. There are many aspects of human behavior and biology that have no impact on our ability to survive and reproduce, and homosexuality is one of them.\n\nIn short, homosexuality exists because it is a natural part of human diversity, and it does not necessarily have any impact on our ability to survive and reproduce as a species."],"13152":["Christmas is a national holiday in many countries, including the United States, because it is a widely celebrated cultural and religious holiday. Many people who are not Christian also celebrate Christmas as a way to spend time with family and friends and to exchange gifts. The concept of \"separation of church and state\" refers to the idea that the government should not favor one religion over another or involve itself in religious matters. In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution protects the freedom of religion and prohibits the government from establishing a state religion or interfering with the free exercise of religion. Despite this, it is not uncommon for governments to recognize certain holidays that are important to a significant number of people within their country, even if those holidays are associated with a particular religion. For example, in the United States, Christmas is a national holiday, but so are holidays like Easter, Thanksgiving, and Hanukkah, which have religious significance for Christians, Jews, and others. In short, Christmas is a national holiday in many countries because it is widely celebrated and has cultural and religious significance for many people. The concept of separation of church and state means that the government should not favor one religion over others, but it does not prevent the government from recognizing and accommodating the religious beliefs and practices of its citizens."],"15937":["An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a type of light that uses a special material called a semiconductor to produce light. When electricity flows through the semiconductor, it creates light.\n\nTo understand how an LED works, it might help to think about how a normal light bulb works. In a normal light bulb, electricity flows through a thin wire called a filament. The filament gets very hot when the electricity flows through it, and this heat makes the filament glow and produce light.\n\nAn LED is different because it doesn't use a filament to produce light. Instead, it uses a semiconductor material. When electricity flows through the semiconductor, it causes the material to give off light. The light is produced when the electrons in the semiconductor combine with \"holes\" (empty spaces where electrons should be). This process is called \"electroluminescence.\"\n\nAn LED is a very efficient way to produce light because it doesn't waste a lot of energy as heat like a normal light bulb does. This is why LED lights are often used in things like flashlights and traffic lights, where it is important to conserve energy."],"9374":["Water on Mars is thought to exist in several different forms, including as ice at the poles and in underground deposits, as well as in small amounts of water vapor in the planet's thin atmosphere. Scientists believe that Mars once had much more water on its surface, including rivers, lakes, and possibly even oceans, but that much of this water has since evaporated or been lost to space.\r\n\r\nThe thin atmosphere on Mars means that the planet doesn't have a strong protective layer like Earth does to keep water from evaporating into space. This means that over time, the water on Mars has been able to escape into the atmosphere and be lost to space.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's important to note that Mars is a dry and barren place, and the amount of water on the planet is very small compared to Earth. Even though some water has been lost to space, there is still some water on Mars, and scientists are studying ways to use this water for future human exploration of the planet. So, the water is still there, but it's just in a different form or location than it was in the past."],"5808":["Simulating 3D space on a computer is relatively straightforward because 3D space is something we can directly perceive and understand. We can see objects in 3D space and move around in it, so it's easy to create a computer program that replicates this experience.\\n\\nHowever, simulating 4D space on a computer is more difficult because it's harder for us to wrap our heads around the concept of 4D space. In 3D space, we can move in three different directions (up\/down, left\/right, and forward\/backward). In 4D space, there is an additional direction (called the \"w\" dimension) that we can't directly perceive or experience.\\n\\nIt's not that we can't simulate 4D space on a computer, it's just that it's harder for us to understand and make sense of what it would look like. Imagine trying to explain to someone what a rainbow looks like if they've never seen one before. It would be difficult to describe all the colors and the way they curve in the sky. It's the same with 4D space \u2013 it's hard to understand and describe because it's something we've never directly experienced."],"6058":["Climate change and climate warming are related, but they are not the same thing. Climate change refers to any long-term shift in the average weather patterns that have been recorded over a period of time. This can include things like changes in temperature, changes in precipitation (like rain and snow), and changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts.\\n\\nClimate warming is one specific type of climate change, in which the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and surface increases over time. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as an increase in the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere that trap heat (like carbon dioxide and methane).\\n\\nSo, to answer your question, climate warming is a part of climate change, but climate change is a broader term that can include many other types of weather-related changes in addition to warming. We use both terms because they are both important to understand, and because they both describe different aspects of the same problem."],"16492":["Grape-flavored things don't taste like grapes because they are made with artificial flavors that are designed to taste like grapes, but are not actually made from grapes.\n\nArtificial flavors are made in a laboratory using a mixture of different chemicals. These chemicals are combined to create a flavor that is similar to the taste of grapes, but they are not actually made from grapes.\n\nThe reason that companies use artificial flavors instead of real grapes is because it is cheaper and easier to use artificial flavors, and they can also be used to create consistent flavors in products.\n\nSo, even though grape-flavored things may taste similar to grapes, they are not actually made from grapes."],"10596":["The Olympic Games are a major international sports event that takes place every four years. While many professional athletes do represent their countries at the Olympic Games, others, like Lionel Messi, do not. This can be for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that the Olympic Games are held during the middle of the professional sports season in many countries, so some players may not be able to participate due to their club or team commitments. For example, the soccer season (also known as football outside the United States) is ongoing during the Olympic Games, and clubs may not want to release their players to participate in the Olympics.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that some sports, like soccer, have separate international tournaments for national teams, such as the World Cup, which take place every four years. This means that national team players like Messi may already have a lot of international commitments and may not have the time or energy to also participate in the Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nFinally, some sports have age restrictions for the Olympic Games, which can prevent older players from participating. For example, in soccer, players must be under the age of 23, with a few exceptions for overage players, to be eligible to play in the Olympic Games. This means that players who are older, like Messi, may not be eligible to participate.\r\n\r\nOverall, there are many different reasons why some professional athletes do not represent their countries at the Olympic Games, including club and team commitments, international tournament schedules, and age restrictions."],"9373":["Lie detectors, also known as polygraphs, are machines that are used to try to determine whether a person is telling the truth or not. They work by measuring different physical responses, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing, while the person being tested answers a series of questions. The theory is that when a person is lying, their body will show certain physical signs of stress or anxiety, which can be detected by the polygraph machine.\r\n\r\nPolygraphs are not 100% reliable, and there is some debate among experts about their accuracy. Some people may be able to \"cheat\" the test by using certain techniques to try to control their physical responses, such as taking deep breaths or biting their tongue. However, most experts believe that these techniques are not very effective, and that polygraphs can still be useful for detecting deception in many cases.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that polygraphs are just one tool that can be used to try to determine whether someone is telling the truth. They are not foolproof, and they should not be used as the sole basis for making important decisions, such as whether to hire someone or whether to charge them with a crime."],"1568":["It's possible that you might have a food allergy or sensitivity to bananas, which can cause you to cough when you eat them. When your body is allergic to a certain food, your immune system mistakes that food for a harmful substance and tries to protect your body by releasing chemicals called histamines. These histamines can cause symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, and itchy eyes. \nIf you think you might be allergic to bananas, it's important to speak with a doctor or allergist. They can help you determine whether you have a food allergy and suggest ways to manage your symptoms. \nOn the other hand, if you don't have a food allergy, there could be other reasons why you might cough after eating a banana. For example, you might have something stuck in your throat or you might be eating the banana too quickly, which can cause you to swallow air along with the food. In these cases, it's usually not a serious problem and the coughing will go away on its own. \nRegardless of the cause, if you find that you're coughing frequently after eating bananas or any other food, it's always a good idea to speak with a doctor to rule out any underlying health problems."],"7805":["The purpose of having health insurance is to help you pay for medical care when you need it. When you have insurance, you don't have to pay for all of your medical bills out of your own pocket. Instead, the insurance company pays a portion of your medical expenses, and you pay a portion through deductibles, copays, and coinsurance.Having a high deductible means that you will have to pay more out of your own pocket before your insurance starts to pay for your medical expenses. However, health insurance plans with high deductibles usually have lower monthly premiums, which can save you money over the long run.It's important to have health insurance because medical care can be very expensive, especially if you have a serious illness or injury. Without insurance, you would have to pay for all of your medical expenses out of pocket, which could be financially devastating. Health insurance helps to protect you and your family from the high cost of medical care and can give you peace of mind knowing that you have coverage if you need it."],"16082":["Breathing is actually a combination of voluntary and involuntary processes. When we are not paying attention to it, our breathing is controlled by the involuntary part of our nervous system, which means that it happens automatically without us having to think about it.\n\nHowever, when we focus on our breathing or try to control it, such as when we do certain types of exercises or meditation, we can use the voluntary part of our nervous system to regulate our breathing. This means that we can intentionally take deeper breaths, hold our breath, or exhale longer, for example.\n\nSo, when we think about how involuntary breathing is, it may seem like it becomes voluntary because we are now actively trying to control it. But even when we are not thinking about it, our body is still automatically controlling our breathing to keep us alive and healthy. Does that make sense?"],"9324":["Sure! Bullet sizing refers to the diameter of the bullet, which is usually measured in millimeters or inches. For example, a .223 bullet is about 22.3 millimeters in diameter, while a .50 caliber bullet is about 50 millimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\nSo, a .50 caliber bullet is much bigger than a .223 bullet. However, size isn't the only factor that determines how powerful a bullet is. There are other factors that can affect a bullet's power, such as the type of gun it's fired from, the amount of gunpowder used, and the shape of the bullet.\r\n\r\nFor example, a .44 caliber Magnum bullet is fired from a powerful handgun, and it has a lot of gunpowder behind it, so it can be very powerful. However, a .50 caliber bullet fired from a rifle might actually have more power, because the rifle can propel the bullet faster and further.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps to clarify things! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"3038":["Sure! Quality Assurance (QA) is a profession that is all about making sure that products or services are the best they can be. QA professionals are responsible for testing and checking the quality of products or services to make sure they meet certain standards. One important thing about QA is that it's not just about finding mistakes or problems. It's also about finding ways to improve the product or service and make it even better. This means that QA professionals need to have a curious and analytical mindset, and be good at problem-solving. Some specific things that QA professionals might do include: Testing products or services to make sure they work properly and meet the requirements set out by the company or organization that made them. Identifying any problems or issues with the product or service, and working with the development team to fix them. Creating and maintaining test plans and procedures to make sure that the product or service is thoroughly tested. Collaborating with other team members to ensure that the product or service meets the needs of the customer. Overall, the goal of QA is to help ensure that products and services are of the highest quality possible, and that they meet the needs and expectations of the people who use them."],"11018":["There are a few reasons why different fuels are used for different purposes. One reason is that some fuels are better suited for certain tasks than others. For example, propane is a very popular fuel for grills because it is easy to store and transport, and it burns cleanly. Methane is often used for stoves because it is a clean-burning fuel that is easy to control. Heating oil is used to heat homes because it is easy to store and transport, and it is relatively inexpensive.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that different fuels are available in different places. For example, if you live in an area where propane is abundant, it might be easier and cheaper to use propane for your grill. On the other hand, if you live in an area where methane is abundant, it might be easier and cheaper to use methane for your stove.\r\n\r\nFinally, different fuels have different environmental impacts. Some fuels, such as propane and methane, are relatively clean-burning and have a lower impact on the environment. Other fuels, such as gasoline and heating oil, produce more pollution when they are burned. As a result, it is important to choose the fuel that is best suited for the task and that has the lowest environmental impact."],"9984":["STDs, or sexually transmitted diseases, are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. This can include vaginal, anal, and oral sex. STDs can also be transmitted through the sharing of needles or other equipment used for injecting drugs.\r\n\r\nThere are many different types of STDs, and they can be caused by a variety of different bacteria, viruses, and other organisms. Some common STDs include gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital herpes, HIV, and syphilis.\r\n\r\nWhen someone has an STD, they may not have any symptoms, or they may have mild or severe symptoms. If someone has an STD and they have sex with someone else, they can pass the infection on to their partner. That's why it's important to practice safe sex, such as using condoms, to reduce the risk of getting an STD. It's also important to get tested regularly and to talk to your sexual partners about your STD status."],"2810":["It's not easy to explain the reasons for discrimination against Jews in a way that would be suitable for a five-year-old, but I will try to provide a brief and simplified explanation. Throughout history, Jews have often been the target of discrimination and persecution because of their religious beliefs and cultural practices. In ancient times, the Romans conquered the land where many Jews lived and imposed their own laws and customs on the conquered people. This led to conflict and persecution of the Jews. In Europe, Jews were often discriminated against and ostracized because they were seen as different and were often excluded from certain jobs and opportunities. In some cases, they were even forced to live in separate areas called ghettos. During the 20th century, the Nazi regime in Germany perpetrated the Holocaust, in which millions of Jews were systematically murdered in concentration camps. This was a horrific example of the extreme hate and discrimination that some people can harbor towards Jews and other minority groups. Discrimination and prejudice against Jews and other groups continue to be a problem in some parts of the world today. It's important to remember that all people deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, regardless of their race, religion, or background."],"6933":["Electrocution is when a person is killed or severely injured by an electric shock. When a person is electrocuted, electricity flows through their body, causing damage to their tissues and organs. This can happen if a person touches a live wire or electrical outlet, or if they come into contact with electricity in some other way.Electricity is a type of energy that can move through materials that allow it to flow easily, like metal. When electricity flows through a person's body, it can cause the muscles to contract, which can make it difficult for the person to move or breathe. It can also cause the heart to stop beating, which can be deadly.Overall, electrocution is dangerous because it can cause serious injury or death by disrupting the normal functioning of the body's tissues and organs. It's important to be careful around electricity and to follow safety guidelines to avoid accidents."],"1430":["Matter can't be destroyed, but it can change form. When a person loses weight, the matter that made up their body doesn't just disappear. It's still there, but it's in a different form. \nFor example, if a person eats food, their body breaks down the food and uses the matter from the food to fuel their body's functions and to build new cells and tissues. When a person loses weight, it means that their body has used up some of the matter that was stored in their fat cells. \nSo, if a person loses 50 pounds, it doesn't mean that the matter just disappears. It's still there, but it's no longer part of the person's body. It might be released into the environment as carbon dioxide through the process of respiration, or it might be excreted through the digestive system. \nIn summary, when a person loses weight, the matter that made up their body is still there, but it has changed form and is no longer part of their body."],"13392":["Fascism is a political ideology that seeks to create a single-party, authoritarian state in which individual freedoms are suppressed in favor of the goals and ideals of the state. Fascists often emphasize the importance of national unity and pride, and they tend to be very militaristic. Fascism is often associated with right-wing politics. Communism, on the other hand, is a political ideology that advocates for the creation of a classless, stateless society in which resources are shared equally and everyone works together for the common good. Communists believe that this can be achieved through the abolition of private property and the creation of a planned economy. Communism is often associated with left-wing politics. So, one way to think about the difference between fascism and communism is that fascism is a right-wing ideology that emphasizes national unity and pride, and communism is a left-wing ideology that emphasizes the importance of working together for the common good."],"6734":["In movies, fighter pilots often use specific phrases and terminology to communicate with each other and with ground control. \"Box 3\" is a phrase that might be used to indicate a specific location or target. For example, a fighter pilot might say \"Box 3, firing missile\" to let their colleagues and ground control know that they are targeting a specific location or object, and that they are launching a missile towards it.It's important to note that the phrases and terminology used by fighter pilots in movies may not necessarily match those used in real life by military pilots. In movies, these phrases and terms are often included to add authenticity and make the film more realistic, but they may not always accurately reflect the way that military pilots communicate in real life."],"3249":["There are several reasons why games may appear to be deeper and better looking now than when the consoles were first released: Improved software and development tools: Over the years, game developers have access to better and more sophisticated software and development tools, which allow them to create more complex and visually impressive games. Increased hardware capabilities: While the hardware in the PS3 and Xbox 360 may be the same as it was when the consoles were first released, game developers have become more skilled at utilizing the hardware to its full potential. This means that games can be more visually impressive and have more complex gameplay. Increased storage capacity: The storage capacity of modern consoles has increased significantly since the PS3 and Xbox 360 were first released. This means that developers can include more content in their games, such as larger and more detailed environments, more complex character models, and more realistic animations. Improved graphics technology: Graphics technology has improved significantly over the years, which allows developers to create more realistic and visually impressive games. Changes in the gaming industry: The gaming industry has changed significantly over the years, with the introduction of new business models such as free-to-play games and in-game microtransactions. This has allowed developers to create more content for their games and continue to support them long after their initial release. Overall, the combination of these factors has allowed game developers to create more complex and visually impressive games over time."],"7163":["Disgust is an emotion that helps us avoid things that could make us sick or harm us. It's important for humans to feel disgust because it helps us avoid things that could harm our bodies or make us sick. For example, if you see something dirty or rotten, disgust helps you not want to touch it or eat it.Animals might not display disgust in the same way that humans do because they don't have the same ability to understand and communicate their emotions as humans do. Different animals also have different ways of protecting themselves from things that could harm them, and some animals might not need to use disgust as a way to stay safe. For example, a cat might use its sense of smell to avoid eating something that could make it sick, while a human might use their sense of disgust to avoid eating something that looks or smells bad."],"414":["If all U.S. troops were to be pulled out of the Middle East, it would depend on the specific country or region in question. In general, it's likely that there would be a power vacuum left behind, as the U.S. military has played a significant role in maintaining stability and providing security in the region. Without the U.S. military presence, other countries or groups may try to fill the power vacuum and exert more influence in the region. This could lead to increased conflict and instability, as different groups compete for power. It's also possible that the withdrawal of U.S. troops could lead to a decrease in U.S. influence and credibility in the region, as other countries may see the U.S. as less committed to maintaining stability and security."],"869":["There are a few reasons why a Valve or Bethesda employee might not spill the beans on projects that everyone is waiting for, even if they have the ability to do so anonymously online. \nFirst, most companies have strict policies in place to protect company secrets. Employees are typically required to sign non-disclosure agreements, which means that they are not allowed to share confidential information about the company or its projects with anyone outside the company. If an employee were to violate this agreement, they could face serious consequences, such as losing their job or being sued by the company. \nSecond, most employees understand that leaking information about a project could harm the company and their own careers. If an employee were to leak information about a project that is not ready to be announced, it could ruin the surprise and create disappointment among fans. It could also harm the company's reputation and make it harder for the company to successfully launch the project in the future. \nFinally, most employees are professional and take pride in their work. They want to see a project succeed and be appreciated by its intended audience, and leaking information about it prematurely would not help that happen."],"12754":["There are a few reasons why people in Ebola-stricken nations might be resistant to accepting help from Ebola workers or relief efforts. First, it's important to understand that the Ebola virus is a highly infectious and deadly disease. It spreads through contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, vomit, and diarrhea, and can be transmitted even after a person has died from the disease. This can make people very afraid of getting sick or spreading the disease to others. Second, in many cases, people may not fully understand how the disease is transmitted or how to protect themselves from getting sick. This can lead to fear and mistrust of outsiders who are trying to help. Third, there may be cultural or societal barriers that make it difficult for people to accept help from outsiders. For example, some people may feel that their community should be able to handle the crisis on their own, without outside help. Finally, it's important to remember that people in Ebola-stricken nations are likely going through a very difficult time. They may be grieving for loved ones who have died, struggling to care for sick family members, or facing other challenges related to the outbreak. In this context, it can be difficult for them to accept help from outsiders, even if they know it's for their own good."],"2116":["Graduate school is a type of school that people go to after they have finished college. It is usually for people who want to get a higher degree, like a Master's degree or a Doctorate. To get into graduate school, people usually need to have a bachelor's degree and good grades. They also need to take a test called the GRE (Graduate Record Exam) and write an essay called a personal statement. In graduate school, people take classes and do research on a specific subject they are interested in. They also might work as a teaching assistant or a research assistant to help pay for their education. Graduate school is different from being an undergraduate because it is more advanced and the classes are usually more difficult. Graduate students also have more freedom to choose what they want to study and do more independent research."],"8401":["There are a few reasons why prices often end in 99 cents rather than rounding up to the nearest dollar. One reason is that it can make the price seem lower to consumers. For example, if something is on sale for $19.99, it might seem like a better deal than if it were priced at $20 even though the difference is only one cent. This is known as \"psychological pricing\" or \"charm pricing.\"\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that it can be easier for stores to price things this way. If everything were priced at the nearest dollar, it might be harder to make small adjustments to the price. For example, if something is on sale for 10% off, it might be easier to take $0.99 off the price than to try to calculate the exact discount on a price that ends in a whole dollar.\r\n\r\nFinally, prices ending in 99 cents are just a convention that has become common in many places. Even though it might not make a lot of sense, it's just something that people have gotten used to seeing."],"4972":["Consultants are people who are hired by companies to give advice and solve problems.

The speed of sound is about 761 mph (1225 km\/h), so if something goes faster than that, it can create a sonic boom.\\n\\nWhen an object moves through the air, it pushes the air molecules out of the way. If the object is moving slowly, the air molecules have time to move away and the sound of the object moving can travel to your ears. But if the object is moving faster than the speed of sound, the air molecules don't have enough time to get out of the way and they pile up in front of the object. This creates a shockwave, which is a line of high pressure air. The shockwave makes a loud noise when it reaches your ears, and that's what we hear as a sonic boom.\\n\\nThe shockwave can also sometimes be seen as a visible line in the sky. This happens because the shockwave can cause changes in the temperature and pressure of the air, which can affect how light is refracted (bent) as it travels through the air. This can cause the shockwave to appear as a visible line or disturbance in the air.\\n\\nI hope that helps explain it! Let me know if you have any more questions."],"4876":["Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of rates of change and the accumulation of quantities. It has many real-world applications in fields such as physics, engineering, and economics.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of calculus is that it allows us to model and understand how things change over time. For example, calculus can be used to understand how fast a car is accelerating, how a population of animals is growing, or how the price of a stock is fluctuating.\\n\\nCalculus also helps us understand and predict the behavior of very complex systems, such as the weather or the stock market. It allows us to make more accurate predictions and make better decisions based on those predictions.\\n\\nIn short, calculus is a powerful tool that helps us understand and analyze change in the world around us. It's a bit like a superpower for math geeks!"],"8483":["Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a healthcare reform law that was passed in the United States in 2010. It aims to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for Americans, particularly for those who previously did not have health insurance or who had difficulty obtaining coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions.\r\n\r\nCanada's socialized medicare, on the other hand, is a universal healthcare system that provides comprehensive coverage for all Canadian citizens and permanent residents. The healthcare system is funded and administered by the government and is available to all Canadians regardless of their ability to pay.\r\n\r\nOne of the main differences between Obamacare and Canada's socialized medicare is the way they are funded and administered. Obamacare relies on a mix of private insurance companies and government subsidies to provide coverage, while Canada's socialized medicare is entirely funded and administered by the government.\r\n\r\nAnother key difference is the scope of coverage provided by each system. Obamacare covers a range of medical services, including preventive care, hospital stays, and prescription drugs, but it does not provide universal coverage for all Americans. In contrast, Canada's socialized medicare provides comprehensive coverage for a wide range of medical services, including hospital stays, physician services, and prescription drugs, for all Canadians.\r\n\r\nOverall, government health care in the United States and Canada is similar in that both systems aim to provide access to quality healthcare for their citizens. However, they differ in the way they are funded and administered and in the scope of coverage they provide."],"3896":["ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. It is a condition that affects the way a person's brain works, and it can make it hard for them to pay attention, sit still, and control their impulses. Children with ADHD may have a lot of energy, be very restless, and have trouble focusing on tasks or following directions. They may also make careless mistakes, lose things easily, and have trouble organizing their thoughts and tasks. Children with ADHD are treated with medications and\/or therapy to help them manage their symptoms and be able to focus better in school and other activities. The medications that are commonly used to treat ADHD, such as stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall, are not the same as methamphetamines, which are highly addictive and dangerous drugs that are often misused. The medications used to treat ADHD are carefully prescribed by doctors and are meant to help children with ADHD manage their symptoms, not to get them \"high.\" It's important to note that every child is different, and treatment for ADHD should be tailored to the individual child's needs. Some children may benefit from therapy alone, while others may need a combination of medication and therapy. It's also important for parents to be involved in the treatment process and to work closely with their child's doctor to find the best treatment plan."],"16126":["In a car, there are gears that help the car go faster or slower. When you are driving on a road, you usually want to be in a higher gear because it helps the car go faster. However, when you are driving up a hill or trying to accelerate quickly, you might need to shift to a lower gear because it gives the car more power.\n\nIn movies, you might see street racing drivers shifting gears a lot because it can look cool and make the scene more exciting. However, in real life, street racing is illegal and very dangerous. It is important to always follow the rules of the road and drive safely."],"4689":["Leaves on a tree stay on the tree even when they are not receiving enough sunlight to make chlorophyll because they are attached to the tree by a stem. The stem is what connects the leaves to the tree and helps to provide the leaves with nutrients and water.

For example, if gasoline prices are lower, people may be more likely to take road trips or travel by car, which can boost the tourism industry. Similarly, if energy prices are lower, businesses may be able to save money on their energy bills, which can help them to be more profitable. \nHowever, falling oil prices can also have negative effects on the global economy. One of the main reasons is that many countries and industries rely heavily on the production and sale of oil as a major source of revenue. When oil prices fall, these countries and industries may struggle to make money, which can lead to job losses and economic downturns. \nAdditionally, falling oil prices can also lead to financial instability in the global economy, as many businesses and countries have taken on significant amounts of debt to finance their oil-related activities. If oil prices fall too low, these businesses and countries may struggle to pay off their debts, which can lead to financial crises and recessions. \nOverall, while lower oil prices can have some positive effects, they can also have negative consequences for certain countries and industries, which can ultimately lead to a global economic downturn."],"47":["When soldiers are killed in conflict, their weapons and gear are often collected and returned to their home country or military base. The weapons are typically taken out of service and either destroyed or stored for later use. The gear, such as clothing and other equipment, is also collected and either cleaned or repaired for reuse or discarded if it is not in good condition. \nIt is important to keep track of and properly dispose of military equipment because it can be dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands. In some cases, the equipment may be donated to other countries or organizations that need it. \nOverall, the goal is to make sure that the equipment is used responsibly and safely, and to ensure that it is not used to harm others."],"10630":["Roman soldiers wore open-toed footwear called \"caligae\" for a few reasons. One reason was that it was practical for marching long distances. The open-toed design allowed for better ventilation and prevented blisters from forming on the soldiers' feet. It also allowed for a better grip on the ground, which was important for soldiers who needed to move quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nSamurai warriors in Japan also wore foot wrappings with exposed footwear, called \"waraji,\" for similar reasons. The foot wrappings helped to keep their feet dry and comfortable, while the exposed toes allowed them to have a better grip on the ground when they were fighting or moving quickly.\r\n\r\nOverall, both the Roman soldiers and the samurai warriors wore open-toed footwear and foot wrappings because they needed to be able to move quickly and efficiently, and these types of footwear helped them to do that."],"12179":["Ebola is a virus that causes a severe and often deadly disease in humans and nonhuman primates. It is thought to be transmitted to people from animals, such as bats or monkeys, and spreads from person to person through direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person. The survival rate for Ebola varies depending on several factors, including the strain of the virus, the person's age and overall health, and the availability of medical treatment. It is not necessarily the case that only 10% of people survive Ebola. In fact, the survival rate for Ebola can be as high as 90% or more in some outbreaks, while in other outbreaks it may be lower. There is no known genetic defense that only a small percentage of people have that enables them to survive Ebola. However, it is possible that some people may have a stronger immune system or other factors that help them better fight off the virus. It is also possible that people who receive prompt and appropriate medical care, such as fluids to prevent dehydration and medications to help manage symptoms, may have a better chance of survival."],"11366":["Easter is a holiday that celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Hacking is when someone unauthorized gains access to someone else's computer or phone without permission. There are many ways that a phone can be hacked, such as through a virus, by guessing someone's password, or by using a special tool to break into the phone. It's possible for a hacker to access someone's personal information, including pictures and messages, if they are able to hack into their phone. This can happen to anyone, not just celebrities. It's important for everyone to take steps to protect their phone and personal information from being hacked. This includes using strong passwords, not clicking on links from unknown sources, and keeping your phone's software up to date with the latest security updates. It's not clear why celebrities might be more likely to have \"nudes\" (nude photographs or videos) on their phones. However, some people might assume this because celebrities are often in the public eye and are subject to a lot of scrutiny and gossip. It's important to remember that everyone has the right to privacy, and it's not okay to invade someone's privacy by hacking into their phone or sharing personal information or images without their consent."],"6383":["Yes, there are several other ways to distribute energy besides electricity. One example is using thermal energy, which can be transported through pipes or tubes to heat buildings or provide hot water. Another example is using mechanical energy, which can be transmitted through gears, belts, and other mechanical devices to power machines and appliances.Electricity was chosen as the default way to distribute energy for a number of reasons. One reason is that electricity is easy to generate and can be produced from a variety of sources, such as coal, natural gas, nuclear power, and renewable sources like solar and wind. Another reason is that electricity can be easily transmitted over long distances through wires, so it is convenient to use in a centralized power system. Finally, electricity is very versatile and can be used to power a wide range of devices and appliances, making it a convenient choice for many different applications."],"178":["It's difficult to predict exactly how languages will evolve over time, but it's likely that if you were thrown into the future, you would be able to understand the English spoken there for at least a few hundred years.

This means that the prices of houses were rising quickly and people were buying houses even if they couldn't afford them.\r\n\r\nSubprime mortgages: Many of the people who bought houses during the housing bubble couldn't afford to pay for them. To get around this, banks started giving out mortgages to people with poor credit, called subprime mortgages. These mortgages had higher interest rates and were more risky, but people thought they could make money by flipping the houses they bought.\r\n\r\nFinancial crisis: When the housing market started to decline and people started defaulting on their mortgages, the value of the subprime mortgages plummeted. This caused a financial crisis because many banks and other financial institutions held these risky mortgages and were now worth much less.\r\n\r\nBankruptcies: As a result of the financial crisis, many banks and financial institutions went bankrupt because they couldn't pay their debts. This caused a lot of uncertainty in the financial market and made it difficult for people and businesses to get loans and make investments.\r\n\r\nThe recession was not something that wealthy and powerful people or banks could have easily prevented. It was caused by a combination of factors that came together to create a perfect storm."],"8909":["Time is a concept that we use to measure the duration of events and the order in which they occur. It is a way of keeping track of the past, present, and future. However, some people believe that time is an illusion because it is a human-made concept and does not exist in the same way that physical objects or events do.\r\n\r\nImagine you are playing a game with a group of friends. The game has rules, and you keep track of how long it takes to complete each round. You might say, \"It took me three minutes to finish this round.\" But the time it takes to complete a round is not an inherent property of the game itself. It is a way of measuring something using a human-made concept.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, time is a way of measuring the duration of events and the order in which they occur, but it is not an inherent property of the universe. Some scientists and philosophers believe that the concept of time is a human invention and that it may not exist in the same way that we experience it.\r\n\r\nSo in this way, time could be considered an illusion because it is a concept that we use to understand and describe the world around us, but it is not a fundamental part of the universe itself."],"12401":["The Aztecs, Mayans, and other Native American cultures were wiped out by diseases carried by the Europeans because they had not previously been exposed to those diseases, so their bodies had not built up immunity to them. This made it easy for the diseases to spread and kill many people. On the other hand, the Europeans had already been exposed to many of the diseases that were common in the Americas, so they had developed immunity to them and were less likely to get sick or die. It's also important to note that the Native American cultures had their own diseases, but the Europeans were immune to most of them because they had already been exposed to similar diseases in Europe. So when the Europeans came to the Americas, they did not get sick from the diseases that were common in the Native American cultures."],"416":["URL_0 is a placeholder that represents a specific URL or web address.

It can be thought of as a way to describe the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system. \nHere's an example to help explain entropy: Imagine you have a jar with 10 red marbles and 10 blue marbles. The jar is organized, with all the red marbles on one side and all the blue marbles on the other side. In this case, the jar has low entropy because everything is very organized and there is little uncertainty about where the marbles are. \nNow imagine that you shake the jar up, so that the marbles are mixed together. Now it is difficult to predict where any individual marble will be when you reach into the jar. In this case, the jar has high entropy because there is a lot of randomness and uncertainty about where the marbles are. \nIn thermodynamics, entropy is often used to describe the randomness or disorder of a system at the molecular level. For example, when a gas is allowed to expand, the molecules will spread out and become more disordered, resulting in an increase in entropy. Similarly, when a substance is cooled, the molecules will slow down and become more organized, resulting in a decrease in entropy. \nI hope this helps to give you a basic understanding of entropy! Let me know if you have any more questions."],"15348":["Mosquitoes are tiny insects that are known for biting people and animals and sucking their blood. While they may not do anything that is directly helpful to humans, they do serve an important role in the ecosystem.\n\nMosquitoes are a food source for many different animals, including birds, bats, and fish. They also help to pollinate flowers and plants, just like bees do. Without mosquitoes, the balance of the ecosystem could be thrown off, which could have negative consequences for the plants and animals that depend on them.\n\nSo while mosquitoes may not seem very helpful to us humans, they do play a vital role in the natural world."],"1754":["Imaginary numbers are numbers that are not real, but are used in math to represent certain types of problems or equations. They are usually written with the letter \"i\" after them, and they can be used to represent the square root of a negative number. For example, if you have the equation \"x^2 + 4 = 0\", you can't solve it with real numbers because there is no real number that you can square to get a negative number. However, you can use an imaginary number to solve the equation. The solution would be \"x = +\/-i*sqrt(4)\". In the real world, imaginary numbers are used in many different fields, including engineering, physics, and computer science.

They are also used in computer graphics to create 3D images on a screen."],"10729":["There are a few reasons why the average fuel efficiency of cars has not increased as much as you might expect in recent decades.\r\n\r\nFirst, the size and weight of cars has generally been increasing over time, which can make them less fuel efficient. This is because larger, heavier cars require more energy to move, which means they need to burn more fuel.\r\n\r\nSecond, people often prioritize other features (such as power and performance) over fuel efficiency when they are shopping for a new car. As a result, car manufacturers may not prioritize fuel efficiency as much as they could.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are many factors that can affect a car's fuel efficiency, including how it is driven (e.g. whether the driver accelerates quickly or drives at a steady pace) and the conditions in which it is driven (e.g. whether it is driven in city traffic or on the highway). All of these factors can make it difficult to compare the fuel efficiency of different cars, even if they are from the same year.\r\n\r\nOverall, while there have been some improvements in fuel efficiency over the years, there is still a lot of room for improvement. Electric cars like Tesla are one way that people are trying to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, but they are not the only solution."],"1051":["There are several ways that people can get upgraded to a better class of service on a plane, such as business or first class. Here are a few possibilities: \n1. Being a frequent flyer: Some airlines offer their frequent flyers (people who fly with them a lot) the opportunity to get upgraded to a better class of service as a reward for their loyalty. This is often done through a frequent flyer program, where passengers earn points for every flight they take and can then redeem those points for upgrades or other rewards. \n2. Having a higher fare class: Sometimes, people who purchase more expensive tickets are more likely to get upgraded to a better class of service. This is because the airline may have more availability in the higher classes and may be more willing to offer upgrades to people who have paid more for their tickets. \n3. Asking at the airport: It's always worth asking at the airport if there are any upgrades available, especially if you are willing to pay a little extra. Sometimes, airlines will have a few seats available in a higher class and will be willing to sell them at a discount, especially if the flight is not full. \n4. Being a VIP or celebrity: Sometimes, people who are well-known or important are offered upgrades as a gesture of goodwill. This is often done to help ensure that these high-profile individuals have a pleasant travel experience. \nOverall, getting upgraded to a better class of service on a plane is not something that happens randomly, but it can be influenced by a variety of factors such as frequent flyer status, fare class, and even celebrity status."],"4166":["Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning the event will not happen and 1 meaning the event will definitely happen.\\n\\nOdds are a way to express the probability of an event happening in the form of a ratio.

The pilot can use the rudder to steer the plane left or right by turning it in the desired direction. When a plane is flying straight, the air flows smoothly over the wings from front to back. This creates lift, which is the upward force that keeps the plane in the air. But when a plane is flying sideways, the air doesn't flow smoothly over the wings. Instead, it hits the wings at an angle, which changes the way the lift is generated. Instead of lifting the plane straight up, the lift acts more like a sideways force that pushes the plane in the direction it's moving. Despite this, planes are still able to fly sideways because they are designed to be stable in the air. This means that they are able to maintain their balance and stay in the air even when they are flying at strange angles or in unusual conditions. So to answer your question, planes are able to fly sideways because they are designed to be stable in the air and can use their rudder to steer in different directions."],"6927":["A supercomputer is a type of computer that is very good at solving problems that require a lot of math to be done very quickly. They are often used for scientific and engineering research, as well as for weather forecasting and other tasks that require a lot of data to be processed. A regular computer is a type of computer that is good at running everyday tasks like browsing the internet, checking email, and creating documents.The main difference between a supercomputer and a regular computer is that a supercomputer is much more powerful. This is because it has more processors (the \"brains\" of the computer) and can do a lot more calculations at the same time. Supercomputers also have a lot more memory (the \"brain's filing cabinet\") than regular computers, which means they can store more data and instructions to help them solve problems faster.Overall, the main difference between a supercomputer and a regular computer is that a supercomputer is much more powerful and is able to solve very complex problems much faster than a regular computer."],"351":["Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a sudden flow of electricity between two charged objects. It can happen when two objects with different electrical charges come into contact with each other, or when an object becomes charged by friction or contact with another charged object. \nMotherboards and circuit boards contain many small electronic components, such as transistors and capacitors, which are very sensitive to ESD. When an ESD event occurs, the sudden flow of electricity can damage or destroy these components, rendering the motherboard or circuit board inoperable. \nThink of it like this: Imagine you have a bucket of water and you want to pour it into a glass. If you pour the water slowly, it will fill up the glass without any problems. But if you pour the water too quickly, it might overflow and spill out, causing a mess. It's similar with ESD and electronic components. A small amount of electricity flowing through the component slowly might not cause any damage, but a large, sudden flow of electricity can be too much for the component to handle and it can be damaged or destroyed. \nSo even though the amount of electricity involved in an ESD event might seem small compared to the power drawn from a power supply, it can still be enough to cause serious damage to sensitive electronic components. That's why it's important to take precautions to prevent ESD when working with electronic equipment."],"15715":["The ability to have multiple orgasms is not limited to one specific gender. Both men and women can potentially have multiple orgasms, although it may be more common for women to experience multiple orgasms.\n\nOrgasms are caused by the release of certain chemicals in the brain and the contractions of certain muscles. These chemicals and muscle contractions can cause a person to feel pleasure and release tension.\n\nAfter an orgasm, the body needs time to recover and replenish these chemicals before another orgasm is possible. This recovery period is known as the refractory period. The refractory period can vary in length from person to person and can be shorter or longer depending on a variety of factors, such as age, physical and emotional health, and previous sexual activity.\n\nSo, while it is not necessarily true that men can only have one orgasm in a sitting while women can have multiple orgasms, it is possible that some men may have a longer refractory period than some women, which could make it more difficult for them to have multiple orgasms in a short period of time. However, this is not a hard and fast rule and can vary greatly from person to person."],"14179":["A battery pack with thousands of tiny cells would not necessarily charge faster than a battery pack with fewer, larger cells. The rate at which a battery charges depends on several factors, including the size of the battery, the type of battery, and the power of the charger. To speed up the charging of devices, there are a few things that can be done: 1. Use a charger with a higher power output: Using a charger with a higher power output can help to speed up the charging process, as the device will be able to draw more power from the charger. 2. Use a \"fast charger\": Some chargers are designed to charge devices faster than others. These are often called \"fast chargers\" and may be able to charge a device in a shorter amount of time. 3. Turn off the device or put it in \"airplane mode\" while charging: When a device is on and being used, it can draw power from the battery even while it is being charged. Turning off the device or putting it in \"airplane mode\" can help to reduce this power drain, allowing the battery to charge faster. 4. Charge the device using a wall outlet instead of a USB port: Charging a device using a wall outlet can be faster than charging it using a USB port on a computer or other device, as the wall outlet may be able to provide more power.

Even though there is no gravity on the ISS, there is still air inside the station, so sound can still travel through it.\\n\\nThe lack of gravity might make it seem like there is no \"up\" or \"down\" on the ISS, but there is still air pressure, which is what helps sound waves travel. So, if you were to talk to someone on the ISS, it would sound pretty much the same as it does on Earth. The only difference might be that the sound waves might travel a little differently because of the shape of the space station, but it wouldn't be very noticeable.\\n\\nOverall, the lack of gravity on the ISS wouldn't have a big impact on how sound moves or how it sounds to people on the station."],"5717":["Black boxes are actually used in many motor vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks. They are typically used to record information about the vehicle's speed, location, and other performance data. This information can be used to help determine what happened in the event of an accident, such as who is at fault or what caused the accident.\\n\\nHowever, there are some challenges to using black boxes in motor vehicles. One challenge is that the data from the black box may be difficult to interpret or may not provide a complete picture of what happened. Another challenge is that black boxes can be expensive to install and maintain, which may not be practical for all vehicles.\\n\\nOverall, while black boxes can be helpful in determining what happened in an accident, they are not a perfect solution and may not always provide all of the information needed to understand the cause of an accident."],"3745":["It's not uncommon for extremely wealthy people to have a salary of $1 or even less. This is often done for tax purposes, as having a low salary can result in a lower tax bill. It's important to understand that a person's salary is just one source of income and does not necessarily reflect their overall wealth. For example, Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and CEO of Facebook, has a net worth of billions of dollars, despite having a salary of just $1 per year. This is because he has a significant ownership stake in Facebook, which has increased in value over the years. It's also worth noting that some extremely wealthy people choose to take a low salary because they don't need the money. For example, they may have a large amount of money saved up or may have other sources of income, such as investments. In these cases, taking a low salary can be a way for a person to show that they are committed to their work and not just in it for the money. In short, having a salary of $1 or less does not necessarily mean that a person is broke. It can be a strategic financial decision that allows a person to minimize their tax bill or show their dedication to their work."],"2534":["The Dougie dance is a hip hop dance style that originated in the United States. It involves moving your body to the rhythm of the music while also doing specific dance moves with your arms, legs, and head. Here's how you can do the Dougie dance: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms relaxed by your sides. Start by swaying your hips and shoulders to the beat of the music. Put your right arm out in front of you, palm facing down. Bend your elbow and bring your hand up to your chest. At the same time, step your right foot back. Bring your left arm up to meet your right arm in front of your chest, palms facing each other. Keep swaying your hips and shoulders and alternate raising and lowering your arms in front of your chest as you continue to dance to the beat. Remember, the key to the Dougie dance is to keep moving to the rhythm of the music and have fun with it! Don't worry about getting every move perfect - just relax and let the music guide you."],"666":["In general, a pub (short for \"public house\") is a place where people can go to have a drink and socialize. Pubs are often found in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world. They usually serve a variety of alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine, and cocktails, and may also serve food. \nA bar is a place where people can go to have a drink, socialize, and sometimes dance. Bars are found in many different countries and serve a variety of alcoholic beverages. \nPubs and bars can have similar names because they often serve similar purposes and may be owned by the same company. Some pub and bar names are based on their location, such as \"The Red Lion\" or \"The White Horse,\" while others are based on the theme or decor of the establishment, such as \"The Pirate's Cove\" or \"The Wild West Saloon.\" \nIn general, the main difference between a pub and a bar is that pubs are more traditional and often have a more relaxed, family-friendly atmosphere, while bars may be more modern and have a more energetic or nightclub-like atmosphere. However, this is not always the case, and some pubs may have a more lively atmosphere, while some bars may have a more laid-back atmosphere."],"6597":["Smell is caused by molecules that are released into the air by certain objects or substances. These molecules travel through the air and eventually reach your nose, where they are detected by special cells called olfactory receptors.When you smell something, it's because these molecules have entered your nose and interacted with the olfactory receptors. The receptors send a signal to your brain, which interprets the signal as a particular smell.Smell does not radiate like sound, but rather it travels through the air in the same way that gases do. When you open a bottle of perfume, for example, the perfume molecules will escape from the bottle and start to spread out through the air. They will continue to spread out until they reach your nose or some other object that they can stick to.So, to summarize, smell is transmitted through the air by molecules that are released from a source. These molecules travel through the air and are eventually detected by your nose, which sends a signal to your brain that is interpreted as a particular smell."],"632":["If your body were sent into space after you died, it would not decompose in the same way that it would on Earth. In space, there is no air or moisture, which are necessary for decomposition to occur. Without these elements, your body would not undergo the usual processes of decay.

The protons and neutrons are in the middle of the atom, and the electrons are tiny balls of energy that move around the outside of the atom.\n\nEach atom is a little bit different from other atoms, depending on how many protons it has. For example, the atoms that make up an apple are different from the atoms that make up a pencil.\n\nSo everything we see and touch is made up of tiny atoms all put together in different ways.

That's why clothes can start to smell if they are not dried properly."],"3602":["Food companies determine expiration dates based on a variety of factors, including the type of food, how it was made, and how it will be stored. For example, ice cream is a perishable food that can spoil if it is not stored properly. It is made with milk, cream, and other ingredients that can go bad if they are not kept at a cold enough temperature. The expiration date is a way for the food company to let you know how long the ice cream will still be good to eat, based on how long it will stay fresh and safe to consume. To determine the expiration date for a particular product, food companies test the product to see how long it will stay fresh and safe to eat. They may do this by storing the product under different conditions, such as at different temperatures or in different types of packaging, to see how long it will last. They also consider how the product will be used and by whom, such as whether it will be eaten at home or in a restaurant. The expiration date is not a hard and fast rule, but rather a guideline to help you know when the product is likely to start going bad. If you keep the product stored properly and follow the instructions on the packaging, it should still be safe to eat after the expiration date, but it may not be as fresh or taste as good."],"16614":["Sure! Binary encoding is a way of representing information using only two symbols: 0 and 1. These symbols are known as \"bits\", and they can be combined to represent any type of data.\n\nImagine you have a box with two different colored balls inside: red and blue. You could use these balls to represent the two symbols in binary code. For example, you could represent the number 0 with a blue ball and the number 1 with a red ball.\n\nNow, let's say you wanted to represent the number 3 in binary. You could do this by putting two balls in the box: a red one to represent the number 1 and a blue one to represent the number 0. This would be written as \"11\" in binary code.\n\nBinary encoding is used in computers and other electronic devices to store and process data because it is very efficient. Because there are only two symbols, it is very easy for computers to read and write binary code quickly.\n\nI hope this helps to explain how binary encoding works!

This process is called combustion.\n\nThe main component of coal is carbon, which is a chemical element that can burn when it reacts with oxygen. When the coal is burned, the carbon in the coal combines with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide, which is a gas that is released into the air.\n\nAs the coal burns, it also produces ash, which is a solid material that is left behind after the coal has burned. The ash is mostly made up of other chemical elements that were present in the coal, such as silicon, aluminum, and iron. These elements do not burn and are left behind as solid particles in the ash.\n\nCharcoal is similar to coal in that it is made up mostly of carbon and is able to burn. However, charcoal is made by heating wood or other organic materials in the absence of oxygen, which removes most of the water, volatile compounds, and other impurities. This leaves behind a solid material that is mostly pure carbon, which is why charcoal burns more easily and produces less smoke than wood. When charcoal burns, it reacts with oxygen in the air just like coal, and produces heat, light, and a number of byproducts, including ash."],"10867":["Emotions are a natural and normal part of being human. It's okay to have emotions and it's okay to show them. However, sometimes our emotions can get the better of us and make us act in ways that we don't want to or that might not be helpful.\r\n\r\nOne way to manage your emotions is to recognize when you are feeling a strong emotion. This can help you take a step back and think about how you want to react. You might take some deep breaths, count to ten, or remind yourself that it's okay to feel this way.\r\n\r\nAnother way to manage your emotions is to find healthy ways to express them. You might talk to a trusted friend or family member, write in a journal, or do something physical like going for a walk or hitting a punching bag.\r\n\r\nIt's also helpful to practice self-care, which means taking care of your physical and emotional needs.

I'd be happy to try to explain Fourier series and transforms in a simple way. Imagine you have a shape, like a square or a triangle. You can draw this shape by connecting a bunch of dots with straight lines. But what if I gave you a bunch of dots and asked you to draw the shape without connecting the dots with straight lines?, This is where Fourier series and transforms come in. They allow us to break a shape down into a bunch of simple waves, and then add those waves back up to get the original shape. The waves we use are called sine and cosine waves, and they have a particular frequency and amplitude (how high or low they are). For example, let's say we want to draw a square. We could start by drawing a sine wave with a very low frequency (meaning the shape repeats itself over a long distance). Then, we could add a sine wave with a higher frequency (meaning the shape repeats itself over a shorter distance). If we add these two waves together, we get a square-like shape. This process of breaking a shape down into simpler waves is called a Fourier transform. And the reverse process, where we take a bunch of waves and add them together to get a shape, is called a Fourier series. I hope this helps!

Here are a few things you can try:\n\nGet enough sleep: Make sure you are getting enough sleep each night. If you are not getting enough sleep, you may not spend enough time in the REM stage of sleep, which is when dreaming is most common.\n\nKeep a regular sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. This can help regulate your body's sleep-wake cycle and may make it easier for you to fall into the deeper stages of sleep where dreaming is more likely to occur.\n\nAvoid screens before bed: The blue light emitted by screens on phones, tablets, and computers can interfere with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle and make it harder to fall asleep.

In other words, if you know someone, and that person knows someone else, and so on, you can eventually get to know anyone in the world through a chain of just six people. This idea is based on the idea that people tend to be connected to each other through their friends, family, and other social connections, and that these connections are usually not very far removed from each other.For example, let's say you want to get to know the President of the United States. You might start by thinking about whether you know anyone who knows someone who knows the President. If you don't know anyone directly connected to the President, you could try to find someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows the President. By following this chain of connections, you can eventually reach the President, even if you don't know him or her personally.The concept of six degrees of separation has been popularized by a play and a movie of the same name, but it has also been studied by social scientists who have found evidence to support the idea that people are connected to each other in this way.

When the sun is low in the sky, such as in the morning or evening, the light has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere before it reaches us. This can cause the light to appear softer, warmer, and more diffuse than when the sun is high in the sky.\\n\\nImagine that you are standing in a field on a sunny day. If the sun is directly overhead, the light will be very bright and strong. However, if you look towards the horizon, you will see that the light is much softer and less intense. This is because the sunlight has to pass through more of the Earth's atmosphere before it reaches you, which causes it to become scattered and diffused. The same thing happens at dawn and dusk, when the sun is low in the sky.\\n\\nIn addition to the angle of the sunlight, the time of day can also affect the color of the light. During the morning and evening, the sun is often closer to the horizon, which can give the sky a warmer, more orange or red color. This is because the shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more easily by the Earth's atmosphere, while the longer wavelengths, such as orange and red, are able to pass through more easily.\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],"9922":["There are many reasons why relations between the United States and Russia have been tense. Some of the main reasons include:\r\n\r\nDifferences in political systems: The United States is a democratic country with a free market economy, while Russia is a semi-authoritarian country with a mixed economy. These differences can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nDifferences in foreign policy: The United States and Russia often have different goals and priorities when it comes to international relations. For example, the United States has historically supported democracy and human rights, while Russia has sometimes prioritized its own national interests over these values.\r\n\r\nDisagreements over conflicts and crises: The United States and Russia have sometimes found themselves on opposite sides of conflicts and crises around the world, such as in Syria and Ukraine.\r\n\r\nA history of mistrust: The United States and Russia have a long and complex history, including periods of cooperation and competition. This history has sometimes left a legacy of mistrust between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe Sochi Olympics, which you mentioned, were a sporting event held in Russia in 2014. At the time, relations between the United States and Russia were already somewhat tense due to some of the reasons listed above. However, the Olympics were generally seen as a success and did not contribute significantly to the tension between the two countries."],"11479":["Dogs bark at the vacuum because they are trying to protect their territory and their family. The vacuum makes a lot of noise and moves around, which can be scary for a dog. They might also bark at the vacuum because they want to play with it.

It's the place where the sun, moon, stars, and planets are. It's a very big area that goes on and on and on, and it's mostly empty.\\n\\nThe space between the planets and stars is not completely empty, though. There is some matter, or stuff, in space, but it's very spread out. This matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms, which are the building blocks of everything in the universe.\\n\\nBut even though there is some matter in space, it's still mostly empty. Imagine if you took a bucket and put just one or two pieces of popcorn in it. The bucket would still mostly be empty, even though there are a couple of pieces of popcorn in it. That's kind of like how space is. There are some stars and planets and other things in it, but it's mostly empty."],"14476":["It's generally not a good idea to reboil water because doing so can concentrate any impurities or contaminants that may be present in the water. Additionally, reboiling water can also cause the dissolved gases in the water to be released, which can give the water an off taste. One exception to this rule is if the water has been previously boiled and then allowed to cool. In this case, it is generally safe to reboil the water as long as it has been stored properly and has not been contaminated in any way. So, it's usually best to just heat up a fresh pot of water when you need it, rather than trying to reboil water that has already been used. This will help to ensure that the water you are using is fresh and of good quality."],"1365":["When blood leaves the body and is exposed to the air, it can start to dry and change color. This is because the oxygen in the air causes a chemical reaction with the iron in the blood, which can cause the blood to turn yellow or brown. \nSo if you smear blood that has already started to dry, it may leave a yellow trail because it has already started to change color. If you were to smear fresh, wet blood, it would be red. \nIt's also important to note that the amount of blood you are bleeding can affect the color. If you are bleeding a lot, the blood may be diluted and appear lighter in color. \nI hope this helps to explain the phenomenon!

This is a time standard that is used all around the world and it is based on the Earth's rotation.\n\nWhen it is noon in UTC, it is also noon in all of the other time zones around the world. However, since the Earth is round, different parts of the Earth are facing the Sun at different times. That's why we have different time zones. For example, when it is noon in UTC, it might be 7:00 AM in New York (which is in the Eastern Time Zone) because the Sun is just starting to rise there.\n\nTo keep all of the clocks in the world synchronized, we use something called a time signal. This is a special radio signal that is sent out from a very accurate clock, called a time standard. The time standard is a very accurate clock that is kept in a special place where the temperature and other conditions are kept very stable. This helps the clock stay accurate.\n\nMost regular clocks, like the one on your phone or the one on your wall, are accurate to within a few seconds. Some clocks are even more accurate and can keep time to within a fraction of a second. However, no clock is perfect and they all lose or gain a little bit of time over time. That's why it's important to set your clock once in a while to make sure it is showing the correct time."],"5366":["\\nTax brackets are a way to set different tax rates for different levels of income. The idea is to make the tax system more fair by making sure that people who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.\\n\\nHere's an example to help explain how tax brackets work:\\n\\nImagine that the tax rate is 10% for people who earn less than $50,000 per year, 20% for people who earn between $50,000 and $100,000 per year, and 30% for people who earn more than $100,000 per year.\\n\\nIf you earn $40,000 per year, you would be in the 10% tax bracket and would have to pay 10% of your income in taxes, which would be $4,000.\\n\\nIf you earn $60,000 per year, you would be in the 20% tax bracket and would have to pay 20% of your income in taxes, which would be $12,000.\\n\\nIf you earn $200,000 per year, you would be in the 30% tax bracket and would have to pay 30% of your income in taxes, which would be $60,000.\\n\\nThe reason we have tax brackets instead of a flat percentage for everyone is to make the tax system more progressive. This means that people who earn more money pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, while people who earn less pay a lower percentage. This helps to reduce income inequality and ensure that everyone pays their fair share."],"10717":["Mechanized legs, also known as exoskeletons or bionic legs, are a type of technology that can help people with paraplegia (paralysis of the legs) walk again. However, they are still being developed and are not yet widely available. There are several reasons for this:\r\n\r\nBuilding a device that can safely and effectively support a person's weight and allow them to walk is very challenging. The device must be strong enough to hold the person up, but also be lightweight and comfortable to wear.\r\n\r\nThe device must also be able to respond to the wearer's movements and intentions, and be able to help them walk smoothly and naturally. This requires sophisticated sensors, computers, and algorithms that can interpret the wearer's body signals and adjust the device's movements accordingly.\r\n\r\nFinally, the device must be affordable and easy to use. This is especially important for people with disabilities, who may have limited financial resources and may need the device to be as simple and straightforward as possible.\r\n\r\nOverall, while mechanized legs have the potential to be a powerful and transformative technology for people with paraplegia, there is still a lot of work to be done to make them a reality."],"13821":["Hooters is a restaurant chain that is known for hiring women as servers and for having a particular type of uniform for its female servers. The uniform includes tight-fitting shorts and a tank top with the Hooters logo on it. The restaurant's business model is based on attracting male customers with the attractiveness of the female servers. In the United States, it is generally not illegal for a company to discriminate on the basis of gender when it comes to hiring. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, it is illegal for an employer to discriminate against someone because of their gender if the discrimination is based on a stereotype or if it is not related to the job duties. In the case of Hooters, it is not illegal for the company to hire only women as servers, because the job duties include wearing a particular type of uniform and the company's business model is based on attracting male customers. However, it is important to note that discrimination on the basis of gender can be illegal in other contexts, such as when it comes to pay or promotions."],"11966":["The Freemasons are a fraternity, or a group of men who come together for fellowship and to work towards personal and collective goals. Freemasonry is a social and charitable organization that traces its roots back to the local fraternities of stonemasons in the Middle Ages. Freemasons use ritual and symbolism drawn from stonemasonry to teach moral lessons and promote self-improvement. Freemasonry is not a religion, but it does have a set of moral values and principles that its members are expected to follow. Freemasons believe in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of all people, and they strive to make a positive difference in their communities through charitable work and other efforts. The Freemasons have a number of lodges, or local chapters, around the world, and they are known for their philanthropy and their contributions to education and other causes. The Freemasons are not the same as the Illuminati, which is a secret society that is said to have existed for hundreds of years and to have a hidden influence on world events. There is no evidence that the Illuminati actually exist, and the Freemasons do not have any connection to them."],"6862":["Non-alcoholic beer is a type of beer that has very little or no alcohol in it. Some people might drink non-alcoholic beer because they want to enjoy the taste of beer without the effects of alcohol, or because they are not allowed to drink alcohol for medical or personal reasons.

Non-alcoholic beer can also be a good option for people who are trying to reduce their alcohol intake or who are in recovery from alcohol addiction."],"10013":["It's important to remember that people's opinions and beliefs about certain things, like hats, can vary widely. Some people may think that certain types of hats, like fedoras, are out of style or not fashionable, while others may think they are perfectly acceptable to wear. It's also possible that people may associate certain types of hats with certain groups of people or certain behaviors, and may have negative feelings towards those associations.\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that it's not necessarily the hat itself that makes a person \"terrible,\" but rather the actions and behavior of the person wearing the hat. It's always important to be kind, respectful, and considerate of others, no matter what you are wearing."],"8305":["The Army and the Marines are both branches of the military that serve the United States. They have different roles and responsibilities within the military.\r\n\r\nThe Army is the largest branch of the military, and it is responsible for land-based military operations. This includes things like fighting on land, protecting the country from threats on land, and providing support to other branches of the military.\r\n\r\nThe Marines, on the other hand, are a smaller branch of the military that is focused on amphibious (meaning both land and water) operations. This means that the Marines are trained to fight on land, but they are also trained to fight from the sea and to be able to land on beaches and other coastal areas. They are often the first to respond to crisis situations and can be sent to a variety of different locations around the world.\r\n\r\nIn general, the Army and the Marines work together to defend the country and to carry out military operations. However, they have different areas of expertise and are often sent to different types of missions based on their unique skills and capabilities. For example, the Army might be sent to a mission on land, while the Marines might be sent to a mission that involves amphibious operations."],"9863":["Great question!

The orange vest and hat are worn to make the hunter more visible to other people who might be in the area, such as other hunters. This helps to prevent accidents where someone might accidentally shoot at the wrong person. The camouflage is still important, even if the hunter is also wearing a bright orange vest and hat, because it can help to break up the hunter's outline and make them harder to see at a distance."],"2767":["Hydraulic fracking, also known as fracking, is a method that is used to extract oil and natural gas from the ground. It involves injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals into the ground at high pressure. This creates cracks, or fractures, in rock formations, which allows the oil and gas to flow more easily and be pumped to the surface. There are both benefits and drawbacks to fracking. Some people think it is a good way to access a valuable source of energy, while others think it is harmful to the environment and can have negative impacts on public health. One benefit of fracking is that it can provide a new source of energy. Fracking can help countries become less dependent on other countries for their energy needs, and it can create jobs in the industry. However, there are also concerns about the potential negative effects of fracking. Some people think that fracking can cause water pollution and that it can contribute to climate change. There are also concerns about the potential for earthquakes to be caused by fracking. There is a lot of research available on fracking, but it can be difficult to find non-biased research. Some studies have found that fracking can have negative impacts on the environment and public health, while others have found no significant negative effects. It is important to carefully consider all of the available research when making decisions about whether or not to support fracking."],"9930":["Hot objects and room temperature objects actually have the same weight, but the way we measure weight can be affected by temperature. When an object is hot, its particles are moving around more rapidly, which can cause the object to expand slightly. This expansion can make the object take up more space, which can affect the way it is weighed on a scale.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have a container filled with hot water. If you try to weigh the container while the water is hot, the scale might show that it weighs more than if you weighed the container when the water was at room temperature. This is because the hot water takes up more space in the container, and the scale is measuring the weight of the container and the water together.\r\n\r\nTo get an accurate measurement of an object's weight, it's important to make sure that the object is at room temperature. This ensures that the object is not expanding or contracting due to changes in temperature, which can affect the weight measurement."],"14594":["Water towers are used to store water so that it can be used when it is needed. When water is used in a building or a neighborhood, it is often pumped up into the water tower. The water is then held in the tower until it is needed, at which point it is released back into the pipes and sent to the buildings or homes that need it. The reason that the water has to be stored in a tower is because of something called \"water pressure.\" When water is pumped from a treatment plant to the buildings and homes that need it, it needs to have a certain amount of pressure in order to flow through the pipes and come out of the faucets. The water tower helps to maintain the correct water pressure by storing the water at a high enough elevation. This way, when the water is released from the tower, it will flow down through the pipes and out of the faucets with the right amount of pressure."],"5682":["The IRA is the Irish Republican Army, a militant organization that has been active in Ireland for over a century. The IRA has sought to end British rule in Northern Ireland and to unite the island of Ireland under a single Irish government.\\n\\nThe IRA is perceived negatively by many people because it has used violence and terrorism in pursuit of its goals. It has carried out bombings and other attacks on both military and civilian targets, and many innocent people have been killed or injured as a result.\\n\\nJeremy Corbyn is a British politician who was the leader of the Labour Party from 2015 to 2020. He has had some controversial associations with the IRA in the past, including attending events honoring IRA members and expressing support for their cause. However, he has also stated that he condemns all violence and terrorism, and has sought to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.\\n\\nTo explain this like you're five: The IRA is a group of people who want to make Ireland one country again, and they sometimes use violence to try to make this happen. Some people don't like Jeremy Corbyn because he has talked to them and said nice things about them, even though they use violence."],"11214":["Corporate personhood is the legal concept that a corporation, a company or organization formed under the laws of a state, can be treated as a person in the eyes of the law. This means that corporations have some of the same legal rights as people.\r\n\r\nOne reason why corporations might be granted some of the same legal rights as people is so that they can enter into contracts, own property, and sue or be sued in court. This can be useful because it allows corporations to conduct business and make decisions in a way that is similar to how people do.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that when a corporation does something wrong, such as causing harm to the environment or to people, it can be held accountable in a court of law. This helps to protect society from harm caused by corporations.\r\n\r\nOverall, the idea behind corporate personhood is to give corporations certain legal rights so that they can operate and be held accountable in a way that is fair and just."],"11876":["The traditional school calendar was designed to accommodate the needs of farmers, who needed their children to be available to help with planting and harvesting crops. This calendar, which usually runs from September to June, has been in place for a long time, and many schools continue to follow it because it is familiar and there is a lot of tradition built around it. Some schools have started to adopt a year-round calendar, which means that they are open for more of the year but have more frequent breaks. However, switching to a year-round calendar can be complex and can have unintended consequences, so many schools have decided to stick with the traditional calendar."],"3641":["Disinfectants are chemicals that are used to kill or inactivate harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, on surfaces and in the air. When a disinfectant is labeled as being 99.99% effective, it means that it is able to kill or inactivate almost all of the microorganisms that it comes into contact with. The remaining 0.01% may include microorganisms that are resistant to the disinfectant, or microorganisms that are present in very small numbers and are not effectively targeted by the disinfectant. It is important to note that no disinfectant is 100% effective at killing all microorganisms. There are many factors that can affect the effectiveness of a disinfectant, including the type of microorganism, the type of surface it is applied to, and the conditions under which it is used. In addition, some microorganisms may be naturally resistant to certain disinfectants, or may develop resistance over time through the process of evolution. It is also important to understand that disinfectants are not designed to kill or inactivate all types of microorganisms. While they may be effective at killing harmful bacteria and viruses, they may not be effective against other types of microorganisms, such as certain types of fungi or spores. In these cases, other methods may be needed to control or eliminate these types of microorganisms."],"8914":["An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

In the case of the global financial crisis (GFC) and the subprime mortgage crisis, the banks that were involved were primarily headquartered in the United States. As a result, it was the responsibility of U.S. regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities to take action against these banks if they were found to have violated any laws or regulations. In contrast, European and Asian regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities do not have the same jurisdiction over American banks and would not be able to fine or sue them for their actions. However, it is possible that American banks could face legal consequences in other countries if they were found to have violated local laws or regulations, or if they were sued in civil court by private parties who were affected by their actions. It's also worth noting that while European and Asian authorities may not have been able to fine or sue American banks directly, they were still impacted by the GFC and subprime mortgage crisis and took steps to address the effects of these events within their own countries. This may have included imposing regulations on banks operating within their borders or taking other actions to protect the stability of their financial systems."],"11983":["Fascism is a type of government where one person or group has complete control over the country and its people.

They might do this for a variety of reasons, such as to create a more exclusive or tight-knit community, or to keep discussions and content within the subreddit from being seen by the general public. \nTo gain access to a private subreddit, you will need to request an invitation from the moderators. This is usually done by sending a message to the subreddit's moderators explaining why you want to join and how you found out about the subreddit. The moderators will then review your request and decide whether to invite you to join the subreddit. \nIt's worth noting that not all private subreddits will accept new members. Some may be closed to new members entirely, or may only allow people to join who are specifically invited by existing members. If you're unable to join a private subreddit that you're interested in, you might try reaching out to the moderators to see if there's anything you can do to be considered for membership."],"8621":["In the United States, the process for replacing members of Congress is through regular elections. Every two years, all 435 members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate are up for re-election. If a member of Congress is not doing a good job or if the constituents want change, they can vote for someone else in the next election.\r\n\r\nThis process allows for regular opportunities for the people to hold their representatives accountable and make changes if they wish. It also ensures that the government is representative of the will of the people, as elected officials are chosen by the voters.\r\n\r\nWhile it might be tempting to think about firing Congress and starting over all at once, it's important to remember that the system of government in the United States is designed to be stable and long-lasting. Making wholesale changes all at once could potentially destabilize the government and create uncertainty and chaos.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that the Constitution of the United States sets out the process for electing and replacing members of Congress, and any changes to that process would require a constitutional amendment.

Instead, a smell is a type of chemical signal that is emitted by a substance and detected by our sense of smell. When you smell something, what you're actually detecting is a group of molecules that have been released into the air. These molecules enter your nose and interact with special cells called scent receptors, which send a signal to your brain telling it what you're smelling. As long as the substance that is emitting the smell is still present and able to release molecules into the air, you will be able to smell it. So, for example, if you have a jar of coffee beans that you open and smell, you will be able to smell the coffee beans as long as they are still in the jar and able to release their aroma. However, if you seal the jar or if the coffee beans start to go stale and lose their aroma, you will no longer be able to smell them. I hope this helps to explain things!

GDP is the total value of all the goods and services produced in a country in a given year. The US has a large and diverse economy, with many different industries and businesses that contribute to its GDP. \nHowever, the US also has a large national debt, which is the total amount of money that the federal government owes to creditors. The national debt is different from GDP because it measures the total amount of money that the government owes, rather than the total value of goods and services produced in the country. \nThe national debt can be thought of as a kind of \"borrowing\" by the government. Just like an individual might borrow money from a bank to buy a house or a car, the government might borrow money to pay for things like infrastructure projects, military spending, and social programs. \nIt's important to note that having a large national debt does not necessarily mean that a country is not wealthy. In fact, many wealthy countries have large national debts. However, it is important for the government to manage its debt responsibly and to have a plan in place to pay it back over time."],"1056":["Injured horses are often put down because their injuries can be severe and may not be able to be fully healed. For example, if a horse breaks a leg, it may not be able to walk or stand properly again, even with medical treatment. This would cause the horse a lot of pain and suffering, and it would not be able to lead a normal, healthy life. In these cases, it is often considered more humane to euthanize the horse, which means to put the horse to sleep in a way that is painless and peaceful. \nIn other cases, a horse's injuries may be able to be treated and the horse may be able to recover. In these cases, the horse may be given medical care and rehabilitation to help it heal. However, this can be expensive and time-consuming, and it may not always be possible to fully heal the horse. \nOverall, the decision to euthanize an injured horse or to try to treat it is often based on the severity of the injury and the chances of a full recovery. The decision is usually made with the well-being of the horse in mind and is intended to prevent the horse from suffering unnecessarily."],"16942":["Freemasonry is a fraternity, or a social organization, that traces its origins to the local fraternities of stonemasons in the Middle Ages.

These ceremonies often involve the use of symbolic gestures and ritual dress, and are intended to teach moral lessons and help members reflect on their own personal development.\n\nIn addition to their meetings and ceremonies, Freemasons also engage in charitable work and support a variety of causes, such as education, disaster relief, and medical research.\n\nIn summary, becoming a Freemason involves joining a fraternity that is focused on personal growth and helping others through charitable work."],"12128":["Asphalt is used for roads because it is a strong and durable material that is able to withstand a lot of weight and wear and tear. It is also very flexible, which means that it is able to withstand changes in temperature and weather conditions without cracking or breaking. While it is true that asphalt can develop potholes and may need to be repaired or repaved over time, it is still a very popular choice for roads because it is relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain. Overall, while there may be other materials that have certain advantages, asphalt is a tried and true choice that works well for many different types of roads in a variety of climates and conditions."],"14815":["Passive aggressive behavior is a way of acting that seems passive on the surface, but is actually meant to hurt or upset someone else.

It means that if you talk to your lawyer about a legal problem or issue, what you say to them is private and cannot be shared with anyone else without your permission.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how it works: Imagine you are in a legal dispute with someone and you go to see a lawyer for advice. You tell the lawyer all the details of the dispute and ask for their help. The lawyer then gives you advice on how to handle the situation. Because of attorney-client privilege, the lawyer cannot tell anyone else what you said to them or what advice they gave you. This is important because it allows you to speak openly and honestly with your lawyer, without worrying that your words will be used against you in court or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, attorney-client privilege is a way to protect your private conversations with your lawyer and make sure they stay private."],"12507":["Purchasing airtime on television or radio for a commercial requires a significant investment of money. The cost of airtime depends on the specific television or radio station, the time of day that the commercial will be aired, and the length of the commercial. In order to purchase airtime, you would need to contact the television or radio station and negotiate a price for the airtime. The station would then produce the commercial for you or you would need to provide your own commercial. It is not uncommon for individuals or small businesses to purchase airtime on local television or radio stations, but it is less common for individuals to purchase airtime on national networks or cable channels. This is because the cost of airtime on these types of stations is typically much higher than the cost of airtime on local stations. There are also rules and regulations that apply to the content of commercials that are aired on television and radio. These rules are put in place to ensure that the commercials are appropriate for all audiences and do not contain false or misleading information. In order to comply with these rules, it is important to carefully review the guidelines provided by the television or radio station before purchasing airtime."],"14534":["Balding and growing a beard are two separate things that have nothing to do with each other.

Unlike animals, plants do not have organs such as muscles and a digestive system that need energy to function. Instead, plants use the energy they produce to grow, produce flowers and fruit, and perform other functions necessary for their survival. \nPlants store excess energy in the form of sugars and other compounds in their leaves, stems, roots, and other parts of the plant. This energy can be used when the plant needs it, such as during times when there is not enough sunlight or water for the plant to photosynthesize. \nSo, while plants do store excess energy, they do not experience obesity because they do not have the same physical structures and processes as animals. They use their excess energy to support their growth and other essential functions, rather than storing it in the same way that animals do."],"7811":["I understand that it can be frustrating to try to visit the bank outside of normal business hours. Banks typically have business hours that align with the work hours of most people, so that customers can conveniently visit the bank during their lunch breaks or before or after work. However, I can understand how this might not always be convenient for everyone. Some banks do offer extended hours or have ATMs that you can use to deposit checks or get cash. You might also be able to deposit checks using your bank's mobile app or website, or by using a mobile check deposit feature through your smartphone.

The briefcase is carried by a military aide who is always close to the President, so that the President can quickly give the order to launch a nuclear attack if needed.\n\nThe nuclear football contains a variety of items, including communication equipment that allows the President to communicate with military leaders and other government officials, and a list of pre-approved targets for a nuclear strike. It also contains the \"Presidential Emergency Satchel,\" which is a small suitcase containing classified materials and codes that the President would need to authenticate a nuclear strike.\n\nThe idea behind the nuclear football is to allow the President to be able to respond quickly to a crisis situation, such as an enemy attack, and to be able to give the order to launch a nuclear strike if necessary to protect the United States. However, it's important to note that the President does not have the authority to launch a nuclear strike on his or her own. The decision to use nuclear weapons is a serious one that involves many people in the government, and it is only taken in the most extreme circumstances."],"12097":["There are a few reasons why hardcover books are not usually bundled with their ebook versions. One reason is that ebook versions of books are often less expensive than hardcover versions, so it would not make sense for the publisher to give away the ebook for free with the purchase of a more expensive hardcover version. Another reason is that some people prefer to read books in physical form, while others prefer to read them electronically. By offering both the hardcover and ebook versions separately, the publisher can cater to both types of readers. Finally, it is possible that publishers are concerned about piracy, but this is not the main reason why hardcover books are not typically bundled with ebook versions."],"7034":["Algorithmic trading is a way to use computers to automatically make trades based on certain rules or instructions. It is sometimes called \"automated trading\" or \"algorithmic trading.\"To use algorithmic trading, people write a set of rules for the computer to follow when making trades.

A function is a way of taking an input (called the \"argument\") and producing an output (called the \"result\").\n\nFor example, let's say you have a function called \"double.\" This function takes a number as its argument and returns that number times two. So if you put 3 into the function, it would give you back 6. If you put in 10, it would give you 20.\n\nWe write functions using a special notation. The letter \"f\" is just a placeholder for the function's name, and \"x\" is a placeholder for the argument. So when we write \"f(x),\" we're saying \"whatever the function is called, here's what we're putting into it.\"\n\nFunctions are very useful because they can help us do the same calculation over and over again without having to remember how to do it every time.

Regular hard drives, on the other hand, use spinning disks to store data, which makes them slower at accessing and transferring files. Imagine you have two rooms, each with a bunch of boxes. In one room, the boxes are all stacked neatly in a corner. In the other room, the boxes are scattered all over the place. If you wanted to find a specific box in the first room, it would be much easier and faster than trying to find it in the second room where the boxes are scattered everywhere. Solid state drives work the same way. Because the data is stored neatly in memory chips, the computer can access it quickly.

For example, people used to have to write letters by hand or deliver messages in person if they wanted to talk to someone who was far away. But then they figured out how to use telegraphs to send messages through wires, and later, they invented phones that let you talk to someone on the other side of the world just by pressing a button. As time went on, people kept coming up with more and more new ideas, and they learned how to make these ideas into real things that people could use. They invented computers that could help them do math really fast and store lots of information, and they made robots that could do tasks that were too dangerous or boring for people to do.

Finally, some people may have medical conditions that make it difficult for them to maintain a healthy weight, regardless of how much they eat or how much money they have."],"11910":["There are a few reasons why bibles and dictionaries often use thin paper: 1. Cost: Thin paper is cheaper to produce than thicker paper, so using it can help reduce the overall cost of producing a book. 2. Weight: Books with a lot of pages can be quite heavy, especially if they are made with thick paper. Using thin paper can help reduce the weight of the book, which makes it easier to carry around and handle. 3. Space: Thin paper takes up less space than thick paper, which means that more pages can be fit into a single book. This can be especially important for bibles and dictionaries, which often have a large number of pages. Overall, the main reason why bibles and dictionaries use thin paper is to make the books more affordable, lightweight, and compact."],"8356":["When we are in a dangerous situation, our bodies respond by releasing adrenaline, a hormone that helps us prepare for fight or flight.

These patterns are made up of tiny ridges on the surface of the skin that help us to grip things and perform everyday tasks. The reason that fingerprints only appear on certain parts of the body is because the skin on these areas is different from the skin on other parts of the body. The skin on the fingertips, palms, and soles of the feet is thicker and more ridged than the skin on other parts of the body, which makes it easier for the fingerprint patterns to form. The patterns on the fingertips, palms, and soles of the feet are also more pronounced because these areas of the body experience a lot of wear and tear, which can cause the skin to become more ridged over time. So, in short, fingerprints only appear on certain parts of the body because the skin on these areas is different and experiences more wear and tear, which helps the fingerprint patterns to form."],"12834":["The Humble Bundle is a company that offers bundles of video games and other digital content at discounted prices.

If you believe this to be in error, please submit your feedback \u2014 your input will aid our research in this area. While it is technically possible to get your nutrients through an IV instead of eating food, it is not a good idea for several reasons. First, food is more than just a source of nutrients. It is also a source of pleasure and enjoyment. When we eat, our brains release chemicals that make us feel good. This is why food is such a big part of social gatherings and celebrations. Second, food provides more than just nutrients. It also provides fiber, which helps keep our digestive system healthy and helps us feel full. IVs do not provide fiber. Third, food provides a balance of nutrients that is difficult to achieve through an IV. For example, it is difficult to get all of the different types of vitamins and minerals that our bodies need through an IV. Finally, our bodies are designed to digest and absorb nutrients from food, not from an IV. While it is possible to get nutrients through an IV, it is not a natural or healthy way for our bodies to get the nutrients they need.

Semen is a fluid that contains sperm, which are tiny cells that can fertilize a female's egg and create a baby. When a man ejaculates, his body goes through a series of physical responses that can make him feel tired afterwards. One reason a man might feel tired after ejaculating is because the muscles in his body have been working hard. During ejaculation, the muscles in the prostate, pelvis, and lower back all contract to help push the semen out of the body. These contractions can be intense and may cause a man to feel a bit tired or weak afterwards. Another reason a man might feel tired after ejaculating is because of the chemicals that are released in the brain during the process. Ejaculation can cause the brain to release chemicals like oxytocin and prolactin, which can make a person feel relaxed and drowsy. Finally, ejaculating can also be physically and mentally exhausting, especially if it has been a while since the last time a man ejaculated. It's not uncommon for men to feel a bit tired after ejaculating, especially if they have been sexually active for an extended period of time.
